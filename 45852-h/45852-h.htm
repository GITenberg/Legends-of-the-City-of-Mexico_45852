<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>These legends of the City of Mexico are
    of my finding, not of my making. They
    are genuine folk-stories. Each one of them is
    a true folk-growth from some obscure curious or
    tragical ancient matter that, taking hold upon
    the popular imagination, has had built up from
    it among the people a story satisfying to the
    popular heart.</p>
<p>Many of them simply are historical traditions
    gone wrong: being rooted in substantial
    facts which have been disguised by the fanciful
    additions, or distorted by the sheer perversions,
    of successive generations of narrators through
    the passing centuries. Others of them have
    for their kernel some unaccounted-for strange
    happening that, appealing to the popular mind
    for an explanation, has been explained variously
    by various imaginative people of varying
    degrees of perception and of intelligence: whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> diverse elucidations of the same mystery eventually
    have been patched together into a single
    story&mdash;that betrays its composite origin by the
    inconsistencies and the discrepancies in which
    it abounds. A few of them&mdash;starting out boldly
    by exalting some commonplace occurrence
    into a marvel&mdash;practically are cut from the
    whole cloth. All of them&mdash;and most obviously
    the most incredible of them&mdash;have the quality
    that gives to folk-stories in general their serious
    value: they reflect accurately the tone of
    thought, and exhibit more or less clearly the
    customs and the conditions, of the time to
    which they belong. Among the older people
    of the City of Mexico, alike the lettered and
    the unlettered, they still are cherished with a
    warm affection and are told with a lively relish&mdash;to
    which is added, among the common people,
    a lively faith. The too-sophisticated younger
    generation, unhappily, is neglectful and even
    scornful of them. Soon, as oral tradition, they
    will be lost.</p>
<p>Most fortunately, the permanent preservation
    in print of these legends&mdash;and of many
    more of the same sort&mdash;long since was assured.
    Because of the serious meaning that is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> them, as side-lights on history and on sociology,
    they have been collected seriously by learned
    antiquarians&mdash;notably by Don Luis González
    Obregón and by Don Manuel Rivera Cambas&mdash;who
    have searched and sifted them; and who
    have set forth, so far as it could be discovered,
    their underlying germs of truth. By the poets&mdash;to
    whom, naturally, they have made a
    strong appeal&mdash;they have been preserved in a
    way more in keeping with their fanciful essence:
    as may be seen&mdash;again to cite two authors of
    recognized eminence&mdash;in the delightful metrical
    renderings of many of them by Don Vicente
    Riva Palacio, and in the round threescore of
    them that Don Juan de Dios Peza has recast
    into charming verse. By other writers of distinction,
    not antiquarians nor poets, various
    collections of them have been made&mdash;of which
    the best is the sympathetic work of Don Angel
    R. de Arellano&mdash;in a purely popular form. By
    the playwrights have been made from the more
    romantic of them&mdash;as the legend of Don Juan
    Manuel&mdash;perennially popular plays. By minor
    writers, in prose and in verse, their tellings and
    retellings are without end.</p>
<p>While the oral transmission of the legends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> among the common people&mdash;by heightening
    always the note of the marvellous&mdash;has tended
    to improve them, the bandying about in print
    to which they have been subjected has worked
    a change in them that distinctly is for the
    worse. In their written form they have acquired
    an artificiality that directly is at odds
    with their natural simplicity; while the sleeking
    of their essential roughnesses, and the
    abatement of their equally essential inconsistencies
    and contradictions, has weakened precisely
    the qualities which give to them their
    especial character and their peculiar charm.</p>
<p>The best versions of them, therefore, are
    those which are current among the common
    people: who were the makers of them in the
    beginning; who&mdash;passing them from heart to
    lip and from lip to heart again through the
    centuries&mdash;have retained in them the subtle
    pith that clearly distinguishes a built-up folk-story
    from a story made by one mind at a
    single melting; whose artless telling of them&mdash;abrupt,
    inconsequent, full of repetitions and of
    contradictions&mdash;preserves the full flavor of
    their patchwork origin; and, most important of
    all, whose simple-souled faith in their verity is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> of the selfsame spirit in which they were made.
    These are the versions which I have tried here
    to reproduce in feeling and in phrase.</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>My first winter in Mexico, twenty-five years
    ago, was spent in Monterey; and there, in a
    small way, my collection of Mexican folk-lore
    was begun. My gathering at that time consisted
    mainly of superstitious beliefs&mdash;omens,
    house-charms, the evil eye, the unlucky day&mdash;but
    it included a version of the story of La
    Llorona essentially identical with the version,
    here given, that I later found current in the
    City of Mexico. The sources from which I
    drew in Monterey were three or four old, and
    old-fashioned, women with whom my wife
    established such friendly relations as to win
    them into freely confidential talk with her;
    the most abundant yield coming from a kindly
    old Doña Miguelita (she was given always
    the affectionate diminutive), who was attached
    loosely as a sort of brevet grandmother to the
    family with whom we were lodged. Had I
    been alone I should not have been able to extract
    any information from these old people.
    It would have been impossible to convince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> them that such matters could be regarded with
    anything but contempt by a man.</p>
<p>In like manner, later, from a most valuable
    source in the City of Mexico, my information
    was to be had only at second-hand. This
    source was our dear Joséfa Correa, who during
    four successive winters at once was our washer-woman
    and our friend. Joséfa's semi-weekly
    visits gave us always a warm pleasure; and her
    talk&mdash;of which she was no miser&mdash;gave us
    always much of interest to ponder upon: she
    being a very wise old woman, with views of life
    that were broad and sound. As she was precisely
    of the class in which the folk-stories of
    the city originated, she was the best of authorities
    for the current popular versions of them:
    but always was it through my wife that her
    tellings of them came to me. Various other
    old women, encountered casually, similarly
    were put under contribution by my wife for
    my purposes. One of the most useful was a
    draggled old seller of rebozos; another, of equal
    value, was a friendly old body whom we fell
    in with at a railway station while waiting
    through two hours for a vagrant train. To me
    all of these women would have been sealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> books; I could have got nothing from them
    without my wife's help.</p>
<p>For that help, and for the help that she has
    given me in searching and in collating my
    authorities for the Legends and for the Notes
    relating to them, I am very grateful to her.</p>
<p>To my friend and fellow-lover of things
    ancient and marvellous, Gilberto Cano, I am
    under signal obligations. In addition to his
    nice appreciation and his wide knowledge of
    such matters, this excellent man&mdash;twenty-four
    years ago, and later&mdash;was the best waiter at
    the Hôtel del Café Anglais. (It is gone, now,
    that admirable little hotel over which the brave
    Monsieur Gatillon so admirably presided&mdash;and
    the City of Mexico distinctly is the worse for
    its loss.) Our acquaintance, that had its beginning
    in my encounters with him in his
    professional capacity, soon ripened into a real
    friendship&mdash;still enduring&mdash;along the line of
    similarity of tastes. His intelligent answers
    to my questions about one or another of the
    many old buildings which attracted our attention
    in the course of our walks about the city&mdash;then
    all new to us&mdash;early impressed upon me a
    serious respect for his antiquarian attainments;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span> and this respect was increased when, after
    making a hesitant offer of them that I accepted
    eagerly, he lent to us several excellent books
    treating of the ancient matters in which we were
    interested: explaining, modestly, that these
    books were his own; and that he had bought
    them in order that he might acquire an accurate
    knowledge of the city in which he had
    been born and in which for all his life he had
    lived. As my own knowledge grew, I found
    that in every instance he had answered my
    questions correctly; and the books which he
    had lent to me were certified to, later, by my
    erudite friend Don José María Vigil, Director
    of the Biblioteca Nacional, as standard authorities&mdash;and
    I bought copies of all of them
    to add to the collection of Mexicana that I then
    was beginning to form.</p>
<p>Gilberto was so obliging as to spend several
    afternoons in our quarters&mdash;coming to us in the
    dull time between luncheon and dinner when
    his professional duties were in abeyance&mdash;that
    I might write at his dictation some of the
    many folk-traditions with which his mind was
    stored. Like our dear Joséfa, he was an
    absolute authority on the current popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span> versions, and he seemed to share her faith in
    them; but he told them&mdash;because of his substantial
    knowledge of Mexican history&mdash;more
    precisely than she told them, and with an
    appreciative understanding of their antiquarian
    interest that was quite beyond her
    grasp.</p>
<p>He was a small man, our Gilberto, with a
    low and gentle voice, and a manner that was
    gentle also&mdash;both in the literal and in the finer
    sense of the word. In the thrilling portions
    of his stories he would lean forward, his voice
    would deepen and gather earnestness, his
    bright brown eyes would grow brighter, and
    his gestures&mdash;never violent, and always appropriate&mdash;would
    enlarge the meaning of his
    words. With the instinct of a well-bred man
    he invariably addressed himself to my wife;
    and through his discourse ran a constant refrain
    of &quot;and so it was, Señorita&quot;&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pues si,
    Señorita</i>&mdash;that made a point of departure for
    each fresh turn in the narrative, and at the
    same time gave to what he was telling an air
    of affirmative finality. Usually he ended with
    a few words of comment&mdash;enlightening as exhibiting
    the popular viewpoint&mdash;either upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span> the matter of his story or by way of emphasizing
    its verity.</p>
<p>His tellings ranged widely: from such important
    legends as those of Don Juan Manuel
    and La Llorona&mdash;his versions of which are
    given in my text&mdash;to such minor matters as
    the encounter of his own brother with a freakish
    ghost who carried the bed on which the
    brother was sleeping from one part of the house
    to another. All the knowledge being on his
    side, I could give him little guidance&mdash;and
    whatever happened to come into his head, in
    the way of the marvellous, at once came out
    of it again for my benefit. Some of his stories,
    while exhaustively complete, and undeniably
    logical, were almost startling in their elemental
    brevity&mdash;as the following: &quot;Once some masons
    were pulling down an old house, and in the wall
    they found many boxes of money. After that,
    those masons were rich&quot;! In justice I should
    add that this succinct narrative merely was
    thrown in, as a make-weight, at the end of a
    long and dramatic hidden-treasure story&mdash;in
    which a kindly old ghost-lady, the hider of the
    treasure, had a leading part.</p>
<p>Because of the intelligent interest that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span> Gilberto took in my folk-lore collecting, it was
    a source of keen regret to him that our meeting
    had not come a little earlier, only two years
    earlier, during the lifetime of his great-aunt:
    who had known&mdash;as he put it comprehensively&mdash;all
    the stories about the city that ever were
    told. I too grieved, and I shall grieve always,
    because that ancient person was cut off from
    earth before I could have the happiness of
    garnering the traditionary wisdom with which
    she was so full charged. But my grief is
    softened&mdash;and even is tinctured with a warm
    thankfulness&mdash;by the fact that a great deal of
    it was saved to me by my fortunate encounter
    with her grand-nephew: who so faithfully had
    treasured in his heart her ancient sayings;
    and who so freely&mdash;to the winning of my
    lasting gratitude&mdash;gave them to me for the
    enrichment of my own store.</p>

<p>This Don Juan Manuel, Señor, was a
    rich and worthy gentleman who had the
    bad vice of killing people. Every night at
    eleven o'clock, when the Palace clock was
    striking, he went out from his magnificent house&mdash;as
    you know, Señor, it still is standing in the
    street that has been named after him&mdash;all
    muffled in his cloak, and under it his dagger in
    his hand.</p>
<p>Then he would meet one, in the dark street,
    and would ask him politely: &quot;What is the
    hour of the night?&quot; And that person, having
    heard the striking of the clock, would answer:
    &quot;It is eleven hours of the night.&quot; And Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> Juan Manuel would say to him: &quot;Señor, you
    are fortunate above all men, because you know
    precisely the hour at which you die!&quot; Then
    he would thrust with his dagger&mdash;and then,
    leaving the dead gentleman lying in the street,
    he would come back again into his own home.
    And this bad vice of Don Juan Manuel's of
    killing people went on, Señor, for a great
    many years.</p>
<p>Living with Don Juan Manuel was a nephew
    whom he dearly loved. Every night they
    supped together. Later, the nephew would
    go forth to see one or another of his friends;
    and, still later, Don Juan Manuel would go
    forth to kill some man. One night the nephew
    did not come home. Don Juan Manuel was
    uneasy because of his not coming, fearing for
    him. In the early morning the city watch
    knocked at Don Juan Manuel's door, bringing
    there the dead body of the nephew&mdash;with a
    wound in the heart of him that had killed him.
    And when they told where his body had been
    found, Don Juan Manuel knew that he himself&mdash;not
    knowing him in the darkness&mdash;had
    killed his own nephew whom he so loved.</p>
<p>Then Don Juan Manuel saw that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> been leading a bad life: and he went to the
    Father to whom he confessed and confessed
    all the killings that he had done. Then the
    Father put a penance upon him: That at midnight
    he should go alone through the streets until
    he was come to the chapel of the Espiración
    (it faces upon the Plazuela de Santo Domingo,
    Señor; and, in those days, before it was a
    gallows); and that he should kneel in front of
    that chapel, beneath the gallows; and that,
    so kneeling, he should tell his rosary through.
    And Don Juan Manuel was pleased because
    so light a penance had been put upon him,
    and thought soon to have peace again in his
    soul.</p>
<p>But that night, at midnight, when he set
    forth to do his penance, no sooner was he come
    out from his own door than voices sounded in
    his ears, and near him was the terrible ringing
    of a little bell. And he knew that the voices
    which troubled him were those of the ones
    whom he had killed. And the voices sounded
    in his ears so wofully, and the ringing of the
    little bell was so terrible, that he could not
    keep onward. Having gone a little way, his
    stomach was tormented by the fear that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> upon him and he came back again to his own
    home.</p>
<p>Then, the next day, he told the Father what
    had happened, and that he could not do that
    penance, and asked that another be put upon
    him. But the Father denied him any other
    penance; and bade him do that which was set
    for him&mdash;or die in his sin and go forever to hell!
    Then Don Juan Manuel again tried to do his
    penance, and that time got a half of the way
    to the chapel of the Espiración; and then again
    turned backward to his home, because of those
    woful voices and the terrible ringing of that
    little bell. And so again he asked that he be
    given another penance; and again it was denied
    to him; and again&mdash;getting that night three-quarters
    of the way to the chapel&mdash;he tried to
    do what he was bidden to do. But he could
    not do it, because of the woful voices and the
    terrible ringing of the little bell.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 455px;"> <img src="images/illus-029.jpg" width="455" height="800" alt="" /> <span class="caption">CAPILLA DE LA ESPIRACIÓN</span> </div>
<p>Then went he for the last time to the Father
    to beg for another penance; and for the last
    time it was denied to him; and for the last time
    he set forth from his house at midnight to go
    to the chapel of the Espiración, and in front of
    it, kneeling beneath the gallows, to tell his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> rosary through. And that night, Señor, was
    the very worst night of all! The voices were
    so loud and so very woful that he was in weak
    dread of them, and he shook with fear, and his
    stomach was tormented because of the terrible
    ringing of the little bell. But he pressed on&mdash;you
    see, Señor, it was the only way to save his
    soul from blistering in hell through all eternity&mdash;until
    he was come to the Plazuela de Santo
    Domingo; and there, in front of the chapel of
    the Espiración, beneath the gallows, he knelt
    down upon his knees and told his rosary
    through.</p>
<p>And in the morning, Señor, all the city was
    astonished, and everybody&mdash;from the Viceroy
    down to the cargadores&mdash;came running to the
    Plazuela de Santo Domingo, where was a sight
    to see! And the sight was Don Juan Manuel
    hanging dead on the gallows&mdash;where the angels
    themselves had hung him, Señor, because of his
    sins!</p>

<h2><a name="LEGEND_OF_THE_OBEDIENT_DEAD_NUN" id="LEGEND_OF_THE_OBEDIENT_DEAD_NUN">LEGEND OF THE OBEDIENT DEAD NUN</a></h2>
<p>It was after she was dead, Señor, that this
    nun did what she was told to do by the
    Mother Superior, and that is why it was a
    miracle. Also, it proved her goodness and her
    holiness&mdash;though, to be sure, there was no
    need for her to take the trouble to prove those
    matters, because everybody knew about them
    before she died.</p>
<p>My grandmother told me that this wonder
    happened in the convent of Santa Brígida when
    her mother was a little girl; therefore you will
    perceive, Señor, that it did not occur yesterday.
    In those times the convent of Santa Brígida
    was most flourishing&mdash;being big, and full of
    nuns, and with more money than was needed
    for the keeping of it and for the great giving
    of charity that there was at its doors. And
    now, as you know, Señor, there is no convent
    at all and only the church remains. However,
    it was in the church that the miracle happened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> and it is in the choir that Sor Teresa's
    bones lie buried in the coffin that was too short
    for her&mdash;and so it is clear that this story is true.</p>
<p>The way of it all, Señor, was this: The
    Señorita Teresa Ysabel de Villavicencio&mdash;so
    she was called in the world, and in religion she
    still kept her christened name&mdash;was the daughter
    of a very rich hacendado of Vera Cruz. She
    was very tall&mdash;it was her tallness that made
    the whole trouble&mdash;and she also was very
    beautiful; and she went to Santa Brígida and
    took the vows there because of an undeceiving
    in love. The young gentleman whom she
    came to know was unworthy of her was the
    Señor Carraza, and he was the Librarian to the
    Doctors in the Royal and Pontifical University&mdash;which
    should have made him a good
    man. What he did that was not good, Señor,
    I do not know. But it was something that
    sent Sor Teresa in a hurry into the convent:
    and when she got there she was so devout and
    so well-behaved that the Mother Superior
    held her up to all the other nuns for a pattern&mdash;and
    especially for her humility and her
    obedience. Whatever she was told to do, she
    did; and that without one single word.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<p>Well, Señor, it happened that the convent
    was making ready, on a day, for the great
    festival of Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe; and
    in the midst of all the whirring and buzzing
    Sor Teresa said suddenly&mdash;and everybody was
    amazed and wonder-struck when she said it&mdash;that
    though she was helping to make ready
    for that festival she would not live to take part
    in it, because the very last of her hours on earth
    was almost come. And a little later&mdash;lying
    on her hard wooden bed and wearing beneath
    her habit the wired shirt of a penitent, with
    all the community sorrowing around her&mdash;Sor
    Teresa died just as she said she would die:
    without there being anything the matter with
    her at all!</p>
<p>Because of the festival that was coming, it
    was necessary that she should be buried that
    very night. Therefore they made ready a
    comfortable grave for her; and they sent to
    the carpenter for a coffin for her, and the
    coffin came. And it was then, Señor, that
    the trouble began. Perhaps, because she was
    so very tall a lady, the carpenter thought that
    the measure had not been taken properly.
    Perhaps, being all so flurried, they really had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> got the measure wrong. Anyhow, whatever
    may have set the matter crooked, Sor Teresa
    would not go into her coffin: and as night was
    near, and there was no time to make another
    one, they all of them were at their very wits'
    end to know what to do. So there they all
    stood, looking at Sor Teresa; and there Sor
    Teresa lay, with her holy feet sticking straight
    out far beyond the end of the coffin; and night
    was coming in a hurry; and next day would be
    the festival&mdash;and nobody could see how the
    matter was going to end!</p>
<p>Then a wise old nun came to the Mother
    Superior and whispered to her: telling her that
    as in life Sor Teresa had been above all else
    perfect in obedience, so, probably, would she
    be perfect in obedience even in death; and advising
    that a command should be put upon her
    to fit into her coffin then and there. And the
    old nun said, what was quite true and reasonable,
    that even if Sor Teresa did not do what
    she was told to do, no harm could come of it&mdash;as
    but little time would be lost in making trial
    with her, and the case would be the same after
    their failure as it was before. Therefore the
    Mother Superior agreed to try what that wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> old nun advised. And so, Señor&mdash;all the
    community standing round about, and the
    candle of Nuestro Amo being lighted&mdash;the
    Mother Superior said in a grave voice slowly:
    &quot;Daughter, as in life thou gavest us always an
    example of humility and obedience, now I order
    and command thee, by thy vow of obedience,
    to retire decorously within thy coffin: that so
    we may bury thee, and that thou mayest rest
    in peace!&quot;</p>
<p>And then, Señor, before the eyes of all of
    them, Sor Teresa slowly began to shrink shorter&mdash;to
    the very letter of the Mother Superior's
    order and command! Slowly her holy feet
    drew in from beyond the end of the coffin; and
    then they drew to the very edge of it; and then
    they drew over the edge of it; and then they
    fell down briskly upon the bottom of it with a
    sanctified and most pious little bang. And
    so there she was, shrunk just as short as she
    had been ordered to shrink, fitting into her
    coffin as cozily as you please! Then they
    buried her, as I have told you, Señor, in the
    comfortable grave in the choir that was waiting
    for her&mdash;and there her blessed shrunken bones
    are lying now.</p>

<h2><a name="LEGEND_OF_THE_PUENTE_DEL_CLERIGO" id="LEGEND_OF_THE_PUENTE_DEL_CLERIGO">LEGEND OF THE PUENTE DEL CLÉRIGO</a></h2>
<p>This priest who was murdered and thrown
    over the bridge, Señor, was a very good
    man, and there was very little excuse for
    murdering him. Moreover, he belonged to a
    most respectable family, and so did the gentleman
    who murdered him, and so did the young
    lady; and because of all that, and because at
    the best of times the killing of a priest is sacrilege,
    the scandal of that murder made a stir
    in the whole town.</p>
<p>At that time&mdash;it was some hundreds of years
    ago, Señor&mdash;there lived in the street that now
    is called, because of it all, the street of the
    Puente del Clérigo, a very beautiful young lady
    who was named Doña Margarita Jáuregui.
    And she, being an orphan, dwelt with her uncle,
    this priest: who was named Don Juan de Nava
    and was a person of rank, being a caballero
    of the orders of Santiago and Calatrava. In
    those days there were few houses upon that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> street, which was the causeway between the
    City and the Indian town of Tlaltelolco; and
    for the greater safety of the Spaniards dwelling
    in the City there was a wide ditch, that this
    bridge crossed, between them and the Indian
    town. Long ago, Señor, Tlaltelolco became a
    part of the City; and the ditch, and the bridge
    over it, are gone.</p>
<p>Now it happened that at the court of the
    Viceroy was a noble young Portuguese gentleman,
    who had great riches and two titles, named
    Don Duarte de Sarraza; and the Viceroy, who
    was the Conde de Salvatierra, very much esteemed
    him because he was of a loyal nature
    and of good heart. Therefore this noble young
    gentleman fell in love with Doña Margarita,
    and she with him; but her uncle, the Padre Don
    Juan, knowing that Don Duarte was a vicious
    young man&mdash;a gambler, and in other ways
    what he should not have been&mdash;forbade his
    niece to have anything to do with him. So
    things rested for a while on those terms, and
    Don Duarte did not like it at all.</p>
<p>Well, it happened on a night, Señor, that
    Don Duarte was at the window of Doña Margarita,
    telling his love for her through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> grating; and while he was so engaged he saw
    Padre Don Juan coming home along the causeway
    by the light of the stars. Then that
    wicked young man went to where the bridge
    was, and when the Padre was come to the
    bridge he sprang upon him and drove his dagger
    deep into his skull. The dagger was nailed
    so fast there, Señor, that he could not drag it
    loose again; and so he bundled the dead priest
    over the wall of the bridge and into the water
    with the dagger still sticking in the skull of
    him; and then he went his way to his home.</p>
<p>Not wishing to have it thought that he had
    committed that murder, Don Duarte did not
    go near Doña Margarita for almost a whole
    year. And then&mdash;because his love for her
    would not suffer him to wait away from her
    longer&mdash;he went in the night-time to meet her
    once more at her window; and he had in his
    heart the wicked purpose to make her come
    out to him, and then to carry her off.</p>
<p>That did not happen&mdash;and what did happen
    is a terrible mystery. All that is known about
    it is this: Very early in the morning the neighbors
    living thereabout found Don Duarte dead
    on the Bridge of the Cleric; and holding him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> fast, a bony knee on his breast and two bony
    hands at his throat strangling him, was a
    skeleton. And the skeleton, Señor, was dressed
    in a black cassock, such as only clerics wear,
    and in the skull of it a rusty dagger was nailed
    fast. Therefore it became generally known that
    Don Duarte had murdered the Padre Don
    Juan; and that the skeleton of the Padre Don
    Juan had killed Don Duarte in just revenge.</p>

<h2><a name="LEGEND_OF_THE_MULATA_DE_CORDOBA" id="LEGEND_OF_THE_MULATA_DE_CORDOBA">LEGEND OF THE MULATA DE CÓRDOBA</a></h2>
<p>It is well known, Señor, that this Mulata of
    Córdoba, being a very beautiful woman,
    was in close touch with the devil. She dwelt
    in Córdoba&mdash;the town not far from Vera Cruz,
    where coffee and very good mangos are grown&mdash;and
    she was born so long ago that the very
    oldest man now living was not then alive. No
    one knew who was her father, or who was her
    mother, or where she came from. So she was
    called La Mulata de Córdoba&mdash;and that was
    all. One of the wonders of her was that the
    years passed her without marking her, and she
    never grew old.</p>
<p>She led a very good life, helping every one
    who was in trouble, and giving food to the
    hungry ones; and she dressed in modest clothes
    simply, and always was most neat and clean.
    She was a very wicked witch&mdash;and beyond that
    nobody really knew anything about her at all.
    On the same day, and at the same hour, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> would be seen by different people in different
    places widely apart&mdash;as here in the City, and in
    Córdoba, and elsewhere variously&mdash;all in precisely
    the same moment of time. She also was
    seen flying through the air, high above the
    roofs of the houses, with sparks flashing from
    her black eyes. Moreover, every night the
    devil visited her: as was known generally,
    because at night her neighbors observed that
    through the chinks in the tight-shut doors and
    windows of her house there shone a bright light&mdash;as
    though all the inside of the house were
    filled with flames. She went to mass regularly,
    and at the proper seasons partook of the
    Sacrament. She disdained everybody; and
    because of her disdainings it was believed that
    the master of her beauty was the Lord of
    Darkness; and that seemed reasonable. Every
    single one of the young men was mad about her,
    and she had a train of lovers from which she
    could pick and choose. All wonders were told
    of her. She was so powerful, and could work
    such prodigies, that she was spoken about&mdash;just
    as though she had been the blessed Santa
    Rita de Cascia&mdash;as the Advocate of Impossible
    Things! Old maids went to her who sought for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> husbands; poor ladies who longed for jewels and
    fine dresses that they might go to the court of
    the Viceroy; miners that they might find silver;
    old soldiers, set aside for rustiness, to get new
    commands&mdash;so that the saying, &quot;<em>I</em> am not the
    Mulata of Córdoba!&quot; is the answer when any
    one asks an impossible favor even now.</p>
<p>How it came about, Señor, no one ever knew.
    What every one did know was that, on a day,
    the Mulata was brought from Córdoba here
    to the City and was cast into the prison of the
    Holy Office. That was a piece of news that
    made a stir! Some said that a disdained lover
    had denounced her to the Inquisition. Others
    said that the Holy Office had laid hands on
    her less because she was a witch than because
    of her great riches&mdash;and it was told that when
    she had been seized ten barrels filled with gold-dust
    had been seized with her. So talk about
    the matter was on every tongue.</p>
<p>Many years went by, Señor, and all of that
    talk was almost forgotten. Then, on a morning,
    the city was astonished by hearing&mdash;no
    one knew from where&mdash;that at the next auto
    de fé the witch of Córdoba would walk with
    the unredeemed ones, carrying the flameless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> green candle and wearing the high bonnet, and
    would be burned at the burning-place of the
    Holy Office&mdash;it was in front of the church of San
    Diego, Señor, at the western end of what now is
    the Alameda&mdash;and so would have burned out of
    her her sins. And before that astonishment was
    ended, there came another and a greater: when
    it was told that the witch, before the very eyes
    of her jailers, had escaped from the prison of
    the Inquisition and was gone free! All sorts of
    stories flew about the city. One said, crossing
    himself, that her friend the devil had helped
    her to her freedom; another said that Inquisitors
    also were of flesh and blood, and that she had
    been freed by her own beauty. Men talked
    at random&mdash;because, neither then nor later,
    did anybody know what really had happened.
    But what really did happen, Señor, was
    this:</p>
<p>On a day, the chief Inquisitor went into the
    prison of the Mulata that he might reason her
    to repentance. And, being come into her
    prison&mdash;it was a long and lofty chamber that
    they had put her into, Señor, not one of the
    bad small cells&mdash;he stopped short in amazement:
    beholding before him, drawn with charcoal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> on the wall of the chamber, a great ship
    that lacked not a single rope nor a single sail
    nor anything whatever that a ship requires!
    While he stood gazing at that ship, wondering,
    the Mulata turned to him and looked strangely
    at him out of her wicked black eyes, and said
    in a tone of railing: &quot;Holy Father, what does
    this ship need to make it perfect?&quot; And to
    that he answered: &quot;Unhappy woman! It is
    thou who needest much to make thee perfect,
    that thou mayest be cleansed of thy sins! As
    for this ship, it is in all other ways so wholly
    perfect that it needs only to sail.&quot; Then said
    the Mulata: &quot;That it shall do&mdash;and very far!&quot;
    and there was on her face as she spoke to him
    a most wicked smile. With astonishment he
    looked at her, and at the ship. &quot;How can
    that be possible!&quot; he asked. &quot;In this manner!&quot;
    she answered&mdash;and, as she spoke, she leaped
    lightly from the floor of the prison to the deck
    of the ship, up there on the wall, and stood
    with her hand upon the tiller at the ship's
    stern.</p>
<p>Then happened, Señor, a very wonderful
    marvel! Suddenly the sails of the ship filled
    and bellied out as though a strong wind were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> blowing; and then, before the eyes of the Inquisitor,
    the ship went sailing away along the
    wall of the chamber&mdash;the Mulata laughing
    wickedly as she swung the tiller and steered it
    upon its course! Slowly it went at first,
    and then more and more rapidly, until, being
    come to the wall at the end of the chamber,
    it sailed right on into and through the solid
    stone and mortar&mdash;the Mulata still laughing
    wickedly as she stood there steering at the
    ship's stern! And then the wall closed whole
    and solid again behind the ship, and only a
    little echoing sound of that wicked laughter
    was heard in the chamber&mdash;and the ship had
    vanished, and the Mulata was out of her prison
    and gone!</p>
<p>The Inquisitor, Señor, who had seen this
    devil's miracle, immediately lost all his senses
    and became a madman and was put into a mad-house:
    where, till death gave peace to him, he
    raved always of a beautiful woman in a great
    ship that sailed through stone walls and across
    the solid land. As for the Mulata, nothing
    more ever was heard of her. But it was generally
    known that her master the devil had
    claimed her for his own.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<p>This story is entirely true, Señor&mdash;as is
    proved by the fact that the Inquisition building,
    in which all these wonders happened, still
    is standing. It is the Escuela de Medicina,
    now.</p>

<h2><a name="LEGEND_OF_THE_CALLEJON_DEL_MUERTO" id="LEGEND_OF_THE_CALLEJON_DEL_MUERTO">LEGEND OF THE CALLEJÓN DEL MUERTO</a></h2>
<p>It is an unwise thing, Señor, and there also
    is wickedness in it, to make a vow to the
    Blessed Virgin&mdash;or, for that matter, to the
    smallest saint in the whole calendar&mdash;and not
    to fulfil that vow when the Blessed Virgin, or
    the saint, as the case may be, has performed
    punctually all that the vow was made for: and
    so this gentleman of whom I now am speaking
    found out for himself, and most uncomfortably,
    when he died with an unfulfilled vow on
    his shoulders&mdash;and had to take some of the
    time that he otherwise would have spent
    pleasantly in heaven among the angels in order
    to do after he was dead what he had promised
    to do, and what he most certainly ought to
    have done, while he still was alive.</p>
<p>The name of this gentleman who so badly
    neglected his duty, Señor, was Don Tristan de
    Alculer; and he was a humble but honorable
    Spanish merchant who came from the Filipinas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> to live here in the City of Mexico; and
    he came in the time when the Viceroy was the
    Marqués de Villa Manrique, and most likely as
    the result of that Viceroy's doings and orderings:
    because the Marqués de Villa Manrique
    gave great attention to enlarging the trade
    with the East through the Filipinas&mdash;as was
    found out by the English corsairs, so that Don
    Francisco Draco, who was the greatest pirate
    of all of them, was able to capture a galleon
    laden almost to sinking with nothing but silver
    and gold.</p>
<p>With Don Tristan, who was of an elderliness,
    came his son to help him in his merchanting;
    and this son was named Tristan also, and was a
    most worthy young gentleman, very capable in
    the management of mercantile affairs. Having
    in their purses but a light lining, their commerce
    at its beginning was of a smallness; and
    they took for their home a mean house in a
    little street so poor and so deserted that nobody
    had taken the trouble to give a name to it:
    the very street that ever since their time has
    been called the Alley of the Dead Man&mdash;because
    of what happened as the result of Don
    Tristan's unfulfilled vow. That they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> most respectable people is made clear by the
    fact that the Archbishop himself&mdash;who at that
    period was the illustrious Don Fray García de
    Santa María Mendoza&mdash;was the friend of them;
    and especially the friend of Don Tristan the
    elder, who frequently consulted with him in
    regard to the state of his soul.</p>
<p>So a number of prospering years passed on,
    Señor, and then, on a time, Don Tristan the
    son went down to the coast to make some buyings:
    and it was in the bad season, and the fever
    seized him so fiercely that all in a moment the
    feet and half the legs of him fairly were inside
    of death's door. Then it was that Don
    Tristan, being in sore trouble because of his
    son's desperate illness, made the vow that I
    am telling you about. He made it to the
    Blessed Virgin of Guadalupe; and he vowed to
    her that if she would save his son alive to him
    from the fever he would walk on his bare feet
    from his own house to her Sanctuary, and that
    there in her Sanctuary he would make his
    thanks to her from the deep depths of his soul.
    And the Blessed Virgin, being full of love and
    of amiability, was pleased to listen to the prayer
    of Don Tristan, and to believe the vow that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> went along with it: wherefore she caused the
    fever immediately to leave the sick Don
    Tristan&mdash;and presently home he came to his
    father alive and well.</p>
<p>But Don Tristan, having got from the Blessed
    Virgin all that he had asked of her, did not give
    to her what he had promised to give to her in
    return. Being by that time an aged gentleman,
    and also being much afflicted with rheumatism,
    the thought of taking a walk of near to
    three miles barefoot was most distasteful to
    him. And so he put his walk off for a week or
    two&mdash;saying to himself that the Blessed Virgin
    would not be in any hurry about the matter;
    and then he put it off for another week or two;
    and in that way&mdash;because each time that he
    was for keeping his vow shivers would come in
    his old feet at dread of being bare and having
    cold earth under them, and trembles would
    come in his old thin legs at dread of more
    rheumatism&mdash;the time slipped on and on, and
    the Blessed Virgin did not get her due.</p>
<p>But his soul was not easy inside of him,
    Señor&mdash;and it could not be, because he was
    playing fast and loose with it&mdash;and so he laid
    the whole matter before his friend the Archbishop:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> hoping that for friendship's sake the
    Archbishop would be so obliging as to dispense
    him from his vow. For myself, Señor, I cannot
    but think that the Archbishop&mdash;for all
    that his position put him in close touch with
    heavenly matters, and gave him the right to
    deal with them&mdash;was not well advised in his
    action. At any rate, what he did was to tranquillize
    Don Tristan by telling him that the
    Blessed Virgin was too considerate to hold him
    to a contract that certainly would lay him up
    with a bad attack of rheumatism; and that
    even&mdash;so wearied out would he be by forcing
    his old thin legs to carry him all that distance&mdash;might
    be the death of him. And so the upshot
    of it was that the Archbishop, being an easy-going
    and a very good-natured gentleman,
    dispensed Don Tristan from his vow.</p>
<p>But a vow, Señor, is a vow&mdash;and even an
    Archbishop cannot cast one loose from it; and
    so they all found out on this occasion, and in a
    hurry&mdash;because the Blessed Virgin, while never
    huffed over trifles, does not let the grass grow
    under her feet when her anger justly is aroused.</p>
<p>Only three days after Don Tristan had received
    his dispensation&mdash;to which, as the event<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> proved, he was not entitled&mdash;the Archbishop
    went on the twelfth of the month, in accordance
    with the custom observed in that matter,
    to celebrate mass at the Villa de Guadalupe in
    Our Lady's Sanctuary. The mass being ended,
    he came homeward on his mule by the causeway
    to the City; and as he rode along easily he
    was put into a great surprise by seeing Don
    Tristan walking toward him, and by perceiving
    that he was of a most dismal dead paleness and
    that his feet were bare. For a moment Don
    Tristan paused beside the Archbishop&mdash;whose
    mule had stopped short, all in a tremble&mdash;and
    clasped his hand with a hand that was of an
    icy coldness; then he passed onward&mdash;saying
    in a dismal voice, rusty and cavernous, that
    for his soul's saving he was fulfilling the vow
    that he had made to her Ladyship: because the
    knowledge had come to him that if this vow
    were not accomplished he certainly would spend
    the whole of Eternity blistering in hell! Having
    thus explained matters, not a word more
    did Don Tristan have to say for himself; nor
    did he even look backward, as he walked away
    slowly and painfully on his bare old feet toward
    Our Lady's shrine.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<p>The Archbishop trembled as much as his
    mule did, Señor, being sure that strange and
    terrible things were about him; and when the
    mule a little came out of her fright and could
    march again, but still trembling, he went
    straight to Don Tristan's house to find out&mdash;though
    in his heart he knew what his finding
    would be&mdash;the full meaning of this awesome
    prodigy. And he found at Don Tristan's
    house what he knew in his heart he would find
    there: and that was Don Tristan, the four lighted
    death-candles around him, lying on his bed
    death-struck&mdash;his death-white cold hands
    clasped on his breast on the black pall covering
    him, and on his death-white face the very look
    that was on it as he went to the keeping of his
    unkept vow! Therefore the Archbishop was
    seized with a hot and a cold shuddering, and
    his teeth rattled in the head of him; and
    straightway he and all who were with him&mdash;perceiving
    that they were in the presence of a
    divine mystery&mdash;fell to their knees in wondering
    awe of what had happened, and together
    prayed for the peace of Don Tristan's soul.</p>
<p>Very possibly, Señor, the Archbishop and
    the rest of them did not pray hard enough; or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> perhaps, Don Tristan's sin of neglect was so
    serious a matter that a long spell in Purgatory
    was required of him before he could be suffered
    to pass on to a more comfortable region and
    be at ease. At any rate, almost immediately
    he took to walking at midnight in the little
    street that for so long he had lived in&mdash;always
    wrapped in a long white shroud that fluttered
    about him in the night wind loosely, and
    carrying always a yellow-blazing great candle;
    and so being a most terrifying personage to
    encounter as he marched slowly up and down.
    Therefore everybody who dwelt in that street
    hurried to move away from it, and Don Tristan
    had it quite to himself in its desertedness&mdash;for
    which reason, as I have mentioned, the Alley
    of the Dead Man became its name.</p>
<p>I have been told by my friend the cargador,
    Señor, and also by several other trustworthy
    persons, that Don Tristan&mdash;though more than
    three hundred years have passed since the death
    of him&mdash;has not entirely given up his marchings.
    Certainly, for myself, I do not think
    that it would be judicious to walk in the
    Callejón del Muerto at midnight even now.</p>

<p>This painter, Señor, who by a miracle
    painted the most beautiful picture of Our
    Lady of Mercy that is to be found in the whole
    world&mdash;the very picture that ever since has
    adorned the Altar del Perdon in the Cathedral&mdash;in
    the beginning of him was a very bad
    sinner: being a Fleming, and a Jew, and many
    other things that he ought not to have been,
    and therefore straight in the way to pass the
    whole of Eternity&mdash;his wickednesses being so
    numerous that time would have been wasted
    in trying to purge him of them in Purgatory&mdash;in
    the hottest torments that the devil his
    master could contrive. He was a very agreeable
    young gentleman, of a cheerful and obliging
    nature, and both witty and interesting in
    his talkings&mdash;for which reason the Viceroy
    had a great liking for his company and had
    him often at the Palace to the banquets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> the festivals of the court. His name, Señor,
    was Don Simon Peyrens; and the Viceroy his
    patron&mdash;in whose suite he had come from
    Spain expressly to beautify the Palace with his
    paintings&mdash;was Don Gastón de Peralta, Marqués
    de Falces: who was the third Viceroy of
    the Province, being the successor to the good
    Don Luis de Velasco when that most worthy
    gentleman ceased to be a Viceroy and became
    an angel in the year 1564.</p>
<p>Well, Señor, it happened some years later&mdash;in
    the time of Don Martín Enriquez de Almanza,
    the fourth Viceroy, with whom Peyrens remained
    in favor&mdash;that the Chapter of the
    Cathedral, desiring to make splendid the Altar
    del Perdon, offered in competition to all the
    painters of Mexico a prize for the most beautiful
    picture of Our Lady of Mercy: which
    picture was to be placed in the centre of that
    altar and to be the chief glory of it. And,
    thereupon, all the painters of Mexico, save
    only Peyrens, entered into that competition
    with a reverent and an eager joy. And then
    it was, Señor, that Peyrens made plain the
    wickedness that was in him by his irreverent
    blasphemies. At a banquet at the Palace a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> very noble gentleman asked him why he alone
    of all the painters of Mexico&mdash;and he the best
    of all of them&mdash;had not entered into the
    competition; to which that sinful young man
    answered with a disdainful and impious lightness
    that the painting of what were called
    sacred pictures was but foolishness and vanity,
    and that he for his part could not be tempted
    to paint one by all the gold in the world!</p>
<p>Talk of that sort, Señor, as you well may
    imagine, scalded the ears of all who heard it&mdash;and
    in the quarter where the punishment of
    such sinning was attended to it made an instant
    stir. In a moment information of that evil
    young man's utterances was carried to the
    Archbishop&mdash;who at that time was the venerable
    Fray Alonzo de Montúfar&mdash;and in another
    moment he found himself lodged behind iron
    bars in a cell in the Inquisition: that blessed
    constrainer to righteousness, for the comforting
    of the faithful, that then was proving its usefulness
    by mowing down the weeds of heresy
    with a very lively zeal.</p>
<p>Being of an incredible hard-heartedness,
    neither the threats nor the pleadings of the
    Familiars of the Holy Office could stir Peyrens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> from the stand that he had taken. Resolutely
    he refused to recant his blasphemies; equally
    resolutely he refused to accept his freedom on
    the condition that he should paint the picture
    of Our Lady&mdash;and he even went so far, when
    they brought him the materials for the making
    of that picture, as to tear the canvas to shreds
    and rags!</p>
<p>And so the days ran on into weeks, and the
    weeks into months, and nothing changed in that
    bad matter: save that the Archbishop, saintly
    man that he was, began to lose his temper; and
    that the Familiars of the Holy Office lost their
    tempers entirely&mdash;and were for settling accounts
    with Peyrens by burning his wickedness
    out of him with heavenly fire.</p>
<p>As it happened, Señor, a great opportunity
    for such wholesome purifying of him was imminent:
    because at that time the preparations
    were being made for the very first auto de fé
    that ever was celebrated in Mexico, and all the
    City was on tiptoe of joyful expectation of it.
    Therefore everybody was looking forward with
    a most pleased interest to seeing that criminally
    stiff-necked painter&mdash;properly clad in a yellow
    coat with a red cross on the back and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> front of it&mdash;walking with the condemned ones;
    and then, on the brasero that had been set up
    in the market-place, to seeing him and his sins
    together burned to ashes; and then to seeing
    those sin-tainted ashes carried to the outskirts
    of the City and scattered pollutingly on the
    muddy marsh.</p>
<p>However, Señor, none of those interesting
    and edifying things happened: because Our
    Lady of Mercy&mdash;and it was just like the good-nature
    of her to do so&mdash;took a hand in the
    affair, and by the working of a loving miracle
    made everything come out smoothly and well.</p>
<p>On a night, as he lay sleeping on his pallet
    in his cell in the Inquisition, Peyrens was
    awakened suddenly he knew not how; and as
    he wakened he found in his nose a smell so
    delectable that he thought that he still was
    asleep and his nose dreaming it: and for him
    to have that thought was quite reasonable,
    Señor, because it was the pure fragrance of
    heaven&mdash;to which, of course, human noses are
    unaccustomed&mdash;that filled the room. Then,
    as he lay on his pallet wondering, a shimmering
    light began to glow softly in the darkness;
    and the light constantly grew stronger and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> stronger until it became a glorious radiance far
    brighter than any sunlight; and then in the
    midst of that resplendency&mdash;yet the heavenly
    sparkle of her making the dazzle of it seem like
    darkness&mdash;Our Lady of Mercy herself appeared
    to him: and he would have died of the glory
    of her, had it not been for the loving kindness
    that shone upon him assuringly and comfortingly
    from her gentle eyes.</p>
<p>Then said to him Our Lady, in a voice
    sweeter than any earthly music: &quot;Little son,
    why dost thou not love me?&quot; And Peyrens&mdash;his
    hard heart melted by that gentle look and
    by that sweet voice, and all of his wickedness
    cured by that loving kindness&mdash;rose from his
    pallet and knelt before Our Lady, saying with
    a deep earnestness: &quot;Queen of Heaven, I
    reverence and I love thee with all the heart of
    me and with all my soul!&quot; Then, for a time,
    a serene strange happiness bemazed him dream-fully&mdash;and
    when his bemazement left him the
    resplendent presence was gone. But with him
    still remained the heavenly radiance that was
    brighter than any sunlight, and the heavenly
    perfume that was sweeter than spikenard and
    lilies; and while he pondered all these mysteries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> awe-bound and wondering, again sounded in his
    ears that heaven-sweet voice&mdash;coming as from
    a great distance, but with a bell-note clearness&mdash;saying
    to him gently and lovingly: &quot;Paint
    now thy picture of me, little son!&quot;</p>
<p>Quite possibly, Señor, in the hurry of the
    moment, Our Lady forgot that Peyrens had no
    canvas&mdash;because in his sinful anger he had
    destroyed it&mdash;on which to paint the picture
    that she commanded of him; but, for myself,
    I think that she meant to set his wits to work
    to find the means by which he could obey her
    command. At any rate, his wits did work so
    well that even as she spoke he saw his way out
    of his difficulty; and in an instant&mdash;all a-thrill
    with joyful eagerness to do Our Lady's bidding,
    and inspired by the splendor of his vision of
    her&mdash;he set himself to painting the portrait of
    her, just as his own eyes had seen her in her
    glory, on the oaken door of his cell.</p>
<p>All the night long, Señor&mdash;working by the
    heaven-light that was brighter than any sunlight,
    and having in his happy nose the heaven
    fragrance that uplifted his soul with the sweetness
    of it&mdash;he painted as one who painted in a
    heaven-sent dream. And when the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> came, and the glimmering daylight took dimly
    the place of the heaven-light, he had finished
    there on the door of his cell the most beautiful
    picture of Our Lady&mdash;as I said in the beginning&mdash;that
    ever has been painted in this mortal
    world: and so it had to be&mdash;because, you see,
    it is the only picture of her that ever has been
    painted of her by one who has beheld her with
    mortal eyes!</p>
<p>As usually is the case with miracles, Señor,
    the outcome of this one was most satisfactory.
    The Archbishop and the Chapter of the
    Cathedral, being brought in haste, instantly
    felt themselves compelled to adore that miraculous
    image; and when they had finished
    adoring it they equally felt themselves compelled
    to declare that Peyrens by his making
    of it had earned both his freedom and the
    prize. Therefore Peyrens was set at liberty
    and most richly rewarded; and the pictured
    door was taken from its hinges and, being
    framed in a great frame of silver, was set upon
    the Altar del Perdon to be the chief glory of
    it; and what was best of all&mdash;because it made
    safe the soul of him for all Eternity&mdash;the
    Archbishop formally confirmed to Peyrens his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> absolution, through Our Lady's loving kindness,
    from his bad heresy and from all his
    other sins.</p>
<p>What became of this Peyrens later, Señor,
    I have not heard mentioned; but in regard to
    the accuracy of all that I have told you about
    him there can be no question: because the
    miracle-picture that he painted still adorns the
    Altar del Perdon, and is the chief glory of it&mdash;and
    there you may see it this very day.</p>

<h2><a name="LEGEND_OF_THE_CALLEJON_DEL_ARMADO" id="LEGEND_OF_THE_CALLEJON_DEL_ARMADO">LEGEND OF THE CALLEJÓN DEL ARMADO</a></h2>
<p>This Alleyway of the Armed One, Señor,
    got its name because long ago&mdash;before it
    had any name at all&mdash;there lived in it an old
    man who went always clad in armor, wearing
    also his sword and his dagger at his side; and
    all that was known about him was that his
    name was Don Lope de Armijo y Lara, and
    that&mdash;for all that he lived so meanly in so
    mean a street in so mean a quarter of the City&mdash;he
    was a rich merchant, and that he came
    from Spain.</p>
<p>Into his poor little house no one ever got so
    much as the tip of his nose, and he lived alone
    there in great mystery. In spite of his riches,
    he had not even one servant; and he himself
    bought his own victuals and cooked them with
    his own hands. Always he was seen armed
    to the teeth [<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">armado hasta los dientes</i>] when he
    went abroad. Under his mean robe was a full
    suit of armor, and in his belt was a long dagger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> and a broad and very long sword; also, when
    at night he went out on strange errands, he
    carried a great pike. Therefore, presently,
    people spoke of him not as Don Lope but as
    El Armado&mdash;and so he was called.</p>
<p>That he was a wicked person was known
    generally. He was very charitable to the
    poor. Every morning he went to pray in the
    church of San Francisco; and he remained
    praying there for hours at a time, kneeling
    upon his knees. Also, at the proper seasons,
    he partook of the Sacrament. Some said that
    through the shut windows of his house, in
    the night-time, they had heard the sound of
    his scourgings as he made penance for his
    sins.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 524px;"> <img src="images/illus-067.jpg" width="524" height="800" alt="" /> <span class="caption">EL CALLEJÓN DEL ARMADO</span> </div>
<p>In the darkness of the darkest of nights&mdash;when
    there was no moon, and especially when
    a dismal drizzling rain was falling&mdash;he would
    be seen to come out from his house in all his
    armor and go stealing away in the direction of
    the Plazuela de Mixcalco. He would disappear
    into the shadows, and not come back
    again until midnight had passed. Then he
    would be heard, in his shut house, counting
    his money. For a long while that would go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> on&mdash;counting, counting, counting&mdash;there was
    no end to the clinking of silver coin. Then,
    when all his money was counted, would be
    heard the sound of scourging, together with
    most lamentable and complaining groanings.
    And, at the end of all, would come a heavy
    clanking&mdash;as of a great iron cover falling
    heavily upon a chest of iron. After that there
    would be no sign of life about the house until
    the morning&mdash;when the Armed One would
    come forth from it and go to San Francisco to
    pray.</p>
<p>The life of that man was a bad mystery,
    Señor, that many wished to uncover by denouncing
    him to justice; but the uncovering
    came of its own accord, and was a greater
    mystery still! On a morning, all the neighbors
    saw the Armed One hanging dead&mdash;hanging
    dead from his own balcony by a cord!
    No one knew what to think; but most thought
    that he had hung himself there in fear that
    denouncement of his crimes would be made
    and that justice would have its hold upon him.
    When the Alcalde came, and made search in
    his house, a very great sum of money was
    found; and, also, were found many skulls of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> men who certainly must have perished at his
    hands.</p>
<p>It is a most curious matter, Señor. I cannot
    see my way through it. But the house is
    gone.</p>

<h2><a name="LEGEND_OF_THE_ADUANA_DE_SANTO" id="LEGEND_OF_THE_ADUANA_DE_SANTO"></a>LEGEND OF THE ADUANA DE SANTO
    DOMINGO<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h2>
<p>This gentleman who for love's sake, Señor,
    conquered his coldness and his laziness
    and became all fire and energy, was named
    Don Juan Gutiérrez Rubín de Celis. He was
    a caballero of the Order of Santiago&mdash;some
    say that he wore also the habit of Calatrava&mdash;and
    the colonel of the regiment of the Tres
    Villas. He was of a lovable nature, and
    ostentatious and arrogant, and in all his ways
    dilatory and apathetic to the very last degree.
    So great were his riches that not even he himself
    knew the sum of them: as you will understand
    when I tell you that on an occasion of
    state&mdash;it was the entry into the City in the year
    1716 of the new Viceroy, the Marqués de Valero&mdash;pearls
    to the value of thirty thousand pesos
    were used in the mere trimming of his casacón.</p>
<p>Being of an age to take part so nobly in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> noble ceremony, he must have been a gentleman
    well turned of forty, Señor, when the
    matters whereof I now am telling you occurred:
    of which the beginning&mdash;and also the middle
    and the ending, because everything hinged
    upon it&mdash;was his falling most furiously in love
    with a very beautiful young lady; and his
    falling in love in that furious fashion was the
    very first sign of energy that in all his lifetime,
    until that moment, he had shown. The name
    of this beautiful young lady with whom he
    fell in love so furiously was Doña Sara de
    García Somera y Acuña; and she was less
    than half as old as he was, but possessed of a
    very sensible nature that made her do more
    thinking than is done usually by young ladies;
    and she was of a noble house, and a blood
    relative of the Viceroy's: for which reason the
    Viceroy&mdash;who by that time was Don Juan de
    Acuña, Marqués de Casafuerte&mdash;was much
    interested in the whole affair.</p>
<p>The love-making of this so notoriously lazy
    gentleman did not at all go upon wheels,
    Señor: because Doña Sara set herself&mdash;as was
    her habit when dealing with any matter of
    importance&mdash;to thinking about it very seriously;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> and the more that she thought about it the
    more she made her mind up that so dull and
    so apathetic a gentleman&mdash;who, moreover,
    was old enough to be her father&mdash;would not in
    the least be the sort of husband that she
    desired. But also, because of her good sense,
    she perceived that much was to be said in favor
    of entering into wedlock with him: because his
    rank and his great wealth made him one of the
    most important personages in the Vice-Kingdom;
    and, moreover, for all that he was old
    enough to be her father, he still was a very
    personable man. And so she thought very
    hard in both directions, and could not in either
    direction make up her mind.</p>
<p>While matters were in this condition, Señor&mdash;Don
    Juan furiously in love with Doña Sara,
    and Doña Sara thinking in that sensible way
    of hers about being temperately in love with
    Don Juan&mdash;something happened that gave
    a new turn to the whole affair. This thing
    that happened was that the Viceroy&mdash;who was
    a great friend of Don Juan's; and who, as I have
    mentioned, was a kinsman of Doña Sara's, and
    much interested in all that was going forward&mdash;appointed
    Don Juan to be Prior of the Consulado;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> that is to say, President of the Tribunal
    of Commerce: which was a most honorable
    office, in keeping with his rank and his riches;
    and which also was an office&mdash;because all the
    work of it could be done by deputy, or even
    left undone&mdash;that fitted in with Don Juan's
    lazy apathy to a hair.</p>
<p>Now at that time, Señor, the building of the
    Aduana de Santo Domingo was in progress&mdash;it
    ceased to be a custom-house many years ago,
    Señor; it is occupied by the Secretaría de
    Comunicaciones now&mdash;and it had been in
    progress, with no great result from the work
    that laggingly was done on it, for a number
    of years. The charge of the making of this
    edifice rested with the Consulado; and, naturally,
    the new Prior of the Consulado was
    even more content than had been his predecessors
    in that office to let the making of it
    lag on.</p>
<p>Then it was, Señor, that there came into the
    sensible mind of Doña Sara a notable project
    for proving whether Don Juan's lazy apathy
    went to the very roots of him; or whether, at
    the very roots of him&mdash;over and above the
    energy that he had shown in his furious love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> for her&mdash;he had energy that she could arouse
    and could set a-going in practically useful
    ways. And her reasoning was this wise: that
    if Don Juan could be stirred by her urgence to
    do useful work with vigor, then was it likely
    that her urgence would arouse him from all
    his apathies&mdash;and so would recast him into the
    sort of husband that she desired to have.
    Therefore Doña Sara told Don Juan that she
    would marry him only on one condition; and
    that her condition was that he should finish
    completely the long-drawn-out building of the
    Aduana within six months from that very
    day! And Don Juan, Señor, was so furiously
    in love with Doña Sara that in the same instant
    that she gave him her condition he accepted
    it; and he&mdash;who never had done a hand's turn
    of work in all his lifetime&mdash;promised her that
    he would do the almost impossible piece of
    work that she had set him to do: and that the
    Aduana should be finished completely within
    six months from that very day!</p>
<p>And then all the City was amazed&mdash;and so,
    for that matter, Don Juan himself was&mdash;by the
    fire and the force and the breathless eagerness
    with which he set himself to the task that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> Doña Sara had put upon him. In a single
    moment he had gone to every one of all the
    architects in the City urging them to take in
    charge for him that almost impossible piece of
    building; and in the very next moment&mdash;every
    one of all the architects in the City having made
    answer to him that what he wanted of them
    could not even by a miracle be accomplished&mdash;he
    himself took charge of it: and with a
    furiousness that matched precisely&mdash;as Doña
    Sara perceived with hopeful satisfaction&mdash;with
    the furiousness of his love.</p>
<p>What Don Juan did in that matter, Señor,
    was done as though in the insides of him were
    tempests and volcanoes! From the Tierra
    Caliente he brought up as by magic myriads of
    negro workmen to do the digging and the heavy
    carrying; all the quarries around the City he
    crammed full of stone-cutters; every mason
    was set to work at wall-laying; every carpenter
    to making the doors and the windows; every
    brick-yard to making the tiles for the roof and
    the floors; every blacksmith to making the
    locks and the hinges and the window-gratings
    and the balcony rails. And in the midst of his
    swarms of laborers Don Juan himself worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> harder than all of them put together; and was
    everywhere at once among them urging them
    to hurry and to hurry; and to any one of them
    who showed even the slightest sign of lagging
    there came from Don Juan's mouth a berating
    volleying of scorpions and snakes and toads!</p>
<p>In very truth, Señor, such was Don Juan's
    raging energy that he was as a frenzied person.
    But it was a frenzy that had no real madness
    in it: because everything that he did and that
    he made to be done was directed by a most
    sensible discretion&mdash;so that not a moment of
    time nor the turn of a hand was wasted, and
    in every single instant the building grew and
    grew. And the upshot of it all was that he
    accomplished just what he had made his whole
    soul up he would accomplish: within the six
    months that Doña Sara had given him to do
    his work in, he did do it&mdash;and even with a little
    time to spare. Three full days before the last
    of his six months was ended the Aduana was
    finished to the very least part of its smallest
    detail; and Don Juan&mdash;all aglow over his
    triumphant fulfilment of Doña Sara's almost
    impossible condition&mdash;carried the key of that
    perfectly completed vast structure to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> Palace, and there placed the key of it in the
    Viceroy's hands!</p>
<p>Moreover&mdash;that all the world might know
    why it was, and for whom it was, that his great
    work had been accomplished&mdash;Don Juan caused
    to be carved on a wall of the building a most
    artfully contrived inscription: that seemed only
    to give soberly his own name, and the names
    of the Consules associated with him, and the
    date of the Aduana's completion; but that was
    so arranged that the first letters of the five
    lines of it together made the initials of Doña
    Sara's name.</p>
<p>Don Juan thus having done what Doña Sara
    had set him to do, and what every one of all the
    architects in the City had declared could not be
    done even by a miracle, it was evident to the
    whole world that at the very roots of him was
    more blazing energy than would suffice for the
    equipment of a half hundred of ordinary men.
    Wherefore Doña Sara was well satisfied&mdash;her
    urgence having stirred him to do that great
    useful work with such masterful vigor&mdash;that
    her urgence equally would arouse him from all
    of his apathies: and so would recast him into
    the sort of husband that she desired to have.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> Therefore Doña Sara immediately gave to Don
    Juan her hand in marriage: and as the Aduana
    still is standing&mdash;and precisely where, faster
    than a miracle, Don Juan built it&mdash;the Señor
    has only to look at it, and to read the inscription
    showing Doña Sara's initials, to know
    both the truth of this curious story and that
    Doña Sara's choice of a husband was well
    made.</p>

<h2><a name="LEGEND_OF_THE_CALLE_DE_LA_QUEMADA" id="LEGEND_OF_THE_CALLE_DE_LA_QUEMADA">LEGEND OF THE CALLE DE LA QUEMADA</a></h2>
<p>Not knowing what they are talking about,
    Señor, many people will tell you that the
    Street of the Burned Woman got its name because&mdash;in
    the times when the Holy Office
    was helping the goodness of good people by
    making things very bad for the bad ones&mdash;a
    woman heretic most properly and satisfactorily
    was burned there. Such is not in the
    least the case. The Quemadero of the Inquisition&mdash;where
    such sinners were burned,
    that their sins might be burned out of them&mdash;was
    nowhere near the Calle de la Quemada:
    being at the western end of what now is the
    Alameda, in quite a different part of the town.
    Therefore it is a mistake to mix these matters:
    and the real truth is that this beautiful young
    lady did herself destroy her own beauty by
    setting fire to it; and she did it because she
    wanted to do it&mdash;that in that way she might
    settle some doubts which were in her heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> It all happened in the time of the good Viceroy
    Don Luis de Velasco: and so you will perceive,
    Señor, that this story is more than three hundred
    years old.</p>
<p>The name of this beautiful young lady who
    went to such lengths for her heart's assuring
    was Doña Beatrice de Espinosa; and the name
    of her father was Don Gonzalo de Espinosa y
    Guevra&mdash;who was a Spanish rich merchant
    who came to make himself still richer by his
    buyings and his sellings in New Spain. Being
    arrived here, he took up his abode in a fine
    dwelling in the quarter of San Pablo, in the
    very street that now is called the Street of the
    Burned Woman because of what presently
    happened there; and if that street was called
    by some other name before that cruel happening
    I do not know what it was.</p>
<p>Doña Beatrice was as beautiful, Señor, as the
    full moon and the best of the stars put together;
    and she was more virtuous than she was beautiful;
    and she was just twenty years old. Therefore
    all the young gentlemen of the City immediately
    fell in love with her; and great
    numbers of the richest and the noblest of them&mdash;their
    parents, or other suitable persons, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> the request for them&mdash;asked her father's permission
    to wed her: so that Doña Beatrice
    might have had any one of twenty good husbands,
    had any one of them been to her mind.
    However&mdash;being a lady very particular in the
    matter of husbands&mdash;not one of them was to
    her liking: wherefore her father did as she wanted
    him to do and refused them all.</p>
<p>But, on a day, matters went differently.
    At a great ball given by the Viceroy in the
    Palace Doña Beatrice found what her heart
    had been waiting for: and this was a noble
    Italian young gentleman who instantly&mdash;as
    all the others had done&mdash;fell in love with her;
    and with whom&mdash;as she never before had done
    with anybody&mdash;she instantly fell in love. The
    name of this young gentleman was Don
    Martín Scipoli; and he was the Marqués de
    Pinamonte y Frantescello; and he was as
    handsome as he was lovable, and of a most
    jealous nature, and as quarrelsome as it was
    possible for anybody to be. Therefore, as I
    have said, Señor, Doña Beatrice at once fell in
    love with him with all the heart of her; and Don
    Martín at once fell in love with her also: and
    so violently that his jealousy of all her other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> lovers set off his quarrelsomeness at such a rate
    that he did nothing&mdash;in his spare time, when
    he was not making love to Doña Beatrice&mdash;but
    affront and anger them, so that he might have
    the pleasure of finding them at the point of his
    sword.</p>
<p>Now Doña Beatrice, Señor, was a young
    lady of a most delicate nature, and her notions
    about love were precisely the same as those
    which are entertained by the lady angels.
    Therefore Don Martín's continual fightings
    very much worried her: raising in her heart
    the dread that so violent a person must be of
    a coarse and carnal nature; and that, being
    of such a nature, his love for her came only
    from his beblindment by the outside beauty of
    her, and was not&mdash;as her own love was&mdash;the
    pure love of soul for soul. Moreover, she was
    pained by his being led on by his jealousy&mdash;for
    which there was no just occasion&mdash;to injure
    seriously, and even mortally, so many worthy
    young men.</p>
<p>Therefore Doña Beatrice&mdash;after much thinking
    and a great deal of praying over the matter&mdash;made
    her mind up to destroy her own beauty:
    that in that way she might put all jealousies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> out of the question; and at the same time prove
    to her heart's satisfying that Don Martín's love for
    her had nothing to do with the outside beauty of
    her and truly was the pure love of soul for soul.</p>
<p>And Doña Beatrice, Señor, did do that very
    thing. Her father being gone abroad from
    his home, and all of the servants of the house
    being on one excuse or another sent out of it,
    she brought into her own chamber a brazier
    filled with burning coals; and this she set beneath
    an image of the blessed Santa Lucía
    that she had hung upon the wall to give strength
    to her in case, in doing herself so cruel an
    injury, her own strength should fail. Santa
    Lucía, as you will remember, Señor, with her
    own hands plucked out her own wonderfully
    beautiful eyes and sent them on a platter to
    the young gentleman who had troubled her
    devotions by telling her that he could not live
    without them; and with them sent the message
    that, since she had given him the eyes that he
    could not live without, he please would let her
    and her devotions alone. Therefore it was clear
    that Santa Lucía was the saint best fitted to oversee
    the matter that Doña Beatrice had in hand.</p>
<p>But in regard to her eyes Doña Beatrice did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> not precisely pattern herself upon Santa Lucía:
    knowing that without them she could not see
    how Don Martín stood the test that she meant
    to put him to; and, also, very likely remembering
    that Santa Lucía miraculously got her eyes
    back again, and got them back even more
    beautiful than when she lost them: because,
    you see, they came back filled with the light
    of heaven&mdash;where the angels had been taking
    care of them until they should be returned.
    Therefore Doña Beatrice bound a wet handkerchief
    over her eyes&mdash;that she might keep
    the sight in them to see how Don Martín stood
    his testing; and, also, that she might spare the
    angels the inconvenience of caring for them&mdash;and
    then she fanned and fanned the fire in the
    brazier until the purring of it made her know
    that the coals were in a fierce blaze. And
    then, Señor, she plunged her beautiful face
    down into the very heart of the glowing coals!
    And it was at that same instant&mdash;though Doña
    Beatrice, of course, did not know about that
    part of the matter&mdash;that the Street of the
    Burned Woman got its name.</p>
<p>Being managed under the guidance and with
    the approval of Santa Lucía, the cruelty that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> this virtuous young lady put upon her own
    beauty could lead only to a good end. Presently,
    when the bitter pain of her burning had
    passed a little, Doña Beatrice bade Don Martín
    come to her; and he, coming, found her clad
    in virgin white and wearing over her poor
    burned face a white veil. And then the test
    that Doña Beatrice had planned for her heart's
    assuring was made.</p>
<p>Little by little, Doña Beatrice raised her
    white veil slowly; and, little by little, Don Martín
    saw the face of her: and the face of her was
    more shudderingly hideous&mdash;her two beautiful
    eyes perfectly alight and alive amid that distorted
    deathliness was what made the shudder
    of it&mdash;than anything that ever he had dreamed
    of in his very worst dream! Therefore, with
    a great joy and thankfulness, Don Martín immediately
    espoused Doña Beatrice: and thence-forward
    and always&mdash;most reasonably ceasing
    to love the outside beauty of her&mdash;gave her,
    as she wanted him to give her, the pure love
    of soul for soul.</p>
<p>For myself, Señor, I think that the conduct
    of that young lady was unreasonable, and that
    Don Martín had just occasion to be annoyed.</p>

<p>This story is not a sad one, Señor, like the
    others. It is a joyful story of a gentleman
    and a lady who loved each other, and were
    married, and lived in happiness together until
    they died. And it was because of his happiness
    that the gentleman caused to be carved
    on the corner of his house, below the balcony
    on which he saw that day the sign which gave
    hope to him, this great green cross of stone
    that is there still.</p>
<p>The house with the green cross on it, Señor,
    stands at the corner of the Calle de la Cruz
    Verde&mdash;the street, you see, was named for it&mdash;and
    the Calle de Migueles. It was a fine house
    in the days when Doña María's father built it.
    Now it is old and shabby, and the saint that
    once stood in the niche above the cross is gone.
    But there is an excellent pulquería there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> Señor&mdash;it is called La Heroina&mdash;where pulque of the
    best and the freshest is to be had every morning
    of every day the whole year round.</p>
<p>I do not know, Señor, when this matter happened;
    but I have heard it told that this gentleman,
    who was named Don Alvaro de Villadiego
    y Manrique, came to Mexico in the train
    of the Viceroy Don Gastón de Peralta&mdash;so it
    must have happened a very long while ago.</p>
<p>This Don Alvaro was a very handsome gentleman&mdash;tall,
    and slender, and fair; and he wore
    clothes of white velvet worked with gold, and a
    blue cap with a white feather; and he rode always
    a very beautiful Arabian horse. His hair
    and his little pointed beard were a golden
    brown, Señor; and he was a sight to behold!</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 446px;"> <img src="images/illus-089.jpg" width="446" height="800" alt="" /> <span class="caption">LA CRUZ VERDE</span> </div>
<p>It happened, on a day, that he was taking
    the air on his Arabian; and he was wearing&mdash;because
    a festival of some sort was in progress&mdash;all
    of his fine clothes. So he came prancing
    down the Calle de Migueles, and in the balcony
    of that corner house&mdash;the house on which the
    green cross now is&mdash;he saw a very beautiful
    young lady, who was most genteel in her appearance
    and as white as snow. He fell in
    love with her on that very instant; and she&mdash;although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> because of her virtue and good training
    she did not show it&mdash;on that very instant
    fell in love with him. Then he made inquiry
    and found that her name was Doña María de
    Aldarafuente y Segura. Therefore he resolved
    to marry her. And so, every day he rode past
    her balcony and looked up at her with eyes full
    of love. As for Doña María, she was so well
    brought up, and her parents watched her so
    narrowly, that it was a long while before she
    made any answering sign. And for that reason,
    Señor, she loved him all the more tenderly in
    her heart.</p>
<p>Then it happened, at the end of a long while,
    that Doña María's mother fell ill; and so, the
    watch upon her being less close, Don Alvaro
    was able to get to her hands a letter in which
    he begged that she would give to him her love.
    And he told her in his letter that&mdash;if she could
    not answer it with another letter&mdash;she should
    give him one of two signs by which he would
    know her will. If she did not love him, she
    was to hang upon the railing of her balcony a
    cross of dry palm-leaves&mdash;and when he saw
    that dry cross he would most certainly, he
    told her, that day die. But if she did love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> him, she was to hang a cross of green palm-leaves
    upon the railing of her balcony&mdash;and
    when he saw that green cross he would know,
    he told her, that she had given him her true
    promise of heaven-perfect happiness for all his
    life long.</p>
<p>Being a lady, Señor, Doña María let some
    days go by before she hung on the railing of her
    balcony any cross at all&mdash;and during those
    days Don Alvaro was within no more than a
    hair's breadth of going mad. And then&mdash;when
    madness was so close to him that with one
    single moment more of waiting his wits would
    have left him&mdash;on a day of days, when the
    spring-time sun was shining and all the birds
    were singing love-songs together, Don Alvaro
    saw hanging on the railing of Doña María's
    balcony a beautiful bright green cross!</p>
<p>Of course, after that, Señor, things went fast
    and well. By the respectable intervention of
    a cleric&mdash;who was the friend of Don Alvaro,
    and who also was the friend of Doña María's
    parents&mdash;all the difficulties were cleared away
    in a hurry; and only a fortnight after the green
    cross was hung on the railing of Doña María's
    balcony&mdash;that fortnight seemed an endless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> time to Don Alvaro, but for such a matter it
    really was the least that a lady could get ready
    in&mdash;they went together before the altar, and
    at the foot of it they vowed to each other
    their love. And what is best of all, Señor,
    is that they kept faithfully their vow.</p>
<p>Then it was, being gladly married, that Don
    Alvaro caused the green cross of stone&mdash;so big
    that it rises to the first floor from the pavement&mdash;to
    be carved on the corner of the house that
    thenceforward they lived in; and it was carved
    beneath the very balcony where had hung the
    green cross of palm-leaves that had given to
    him Doña María's true promise of heaven-perfect
    happiness for all his life long.</p>
<p>And there the green cross still is, Señor;
    and the name of the street, as I have told you,
    is the Calle de la Cruz Verde&mdash;which of course
    proves that this story is true.</p>

<p>I do not know when this matter happened,
    Señor; but my grandfather, who told me
    about it, spoke as though all three of them&mdash;the
    priest, and the blacksmith, and the woman&mdash;had
    lived a long while before his time. However,
    my grandfather said that the priest and
    the woman, who was his housekeeper, pretty
    certainly lived in a house&mdash;it is gone now,
    Señor&mdash;that was in the street that is called the
    Puerta Falsa de Santo Domingo. And he said
    that the blacksmith certainly did live in a
    house in the Calle de las Rejas de la Balvanera&mdash;because
    he himself had seen the house, and had
    seen the farrier's knife and the pincers cut on
    the stone arching above the door. Therefore
    you perceive, Señor, that my grandfather was
    well acquainted with these people, and that
    this story is true.</p>
<p>The priest was a secular, Señor, not belonging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> to any Order; and he and the blacksmith
    were compadres together&mdash;that is to say, they
    were close friends. It was because the blacksmith
    had a great liking for his compadre, and
    a great respect for him, that from time to time
    he urged him to send away the housekeeper;
    but his compadre always had some pleasant
    excuse to make about the matter, and so the
    blacksmith would be put off. And things went
    on that way for a number of years.</p>
<p>Now it happened, on a night, that the blacksmith
    was wakened out of his sleep by a great
    pounding at the door of his house; and when
    he got up and went to his door he found standing
    there two blacks&mdash;they were men whom
    he never had laid eyes on&mdash;and with them was
    a she mule that they had brought to be shod.
    The blacks made their excuses to him politely
    for waking him at that bad hour: telling him
    that the mule belonged to his compadre, and
    had been sent to him to be shod in the night
    and in a hurry because his compadre of a sudden
    had occasion to go upon a journey, and
    that he must start upon his journey very early
    on the morning of the following day. Then the
    blacksmith, looking closely at the mule, saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> that she really was the mule of his compadre;
    and so, for friendship's sake, he shod her without
    more words. The blacks led the mule
    away when the shoeing was finished; and, as
    they went off into the night with her, they fell
    to beating her so cruelly with heavy sticks
    that the blacksmith talked to them with great
    severity. But the blacks kept on beating the
    mule, and even after they were lost in the darkness
    the blacksmith continued to hear the
    sound of their blows.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 529px;"> <img src="images/illus-097.jpg" width="529" height="800" alt="" /> <span class="caption">LA MVJER HERRADA</span> </div>
<p>In some ways this whole matter seemed so
    strange to the blacksmith that he wanted to
    know more about it. Therefore he got up very
    early in the morning and went to his compadre's
    house: meaning to ask him what was
    the occasion of this journey that had to be taken
    in such a hurry, and who those strange blacks
    were who so cruelly had beaten his meritorious
    mule. But when he was come to the house
    he had to wait a while before the door was
    opened; and when at last it did open, there was
    his compadre half asleep&mdash;and his compadre
    said that he was not going on any journey, and
    that most certainly he had not sent his mule
    to be shod. And then, as he got wider awake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> he began to laugh at the blacksmith because
    of the trick that had been put upon him; and
    that the woman might share in the joke of it&mdash;they
    all were great friends together&mdash;he knocked
    at the door of her room and called to her.
    But the woman did not answer back to him;
    and when he knocked louder and louder she
    still gave no sign.</p>
<p>Then he, and the blacksmith too, became
    anxious about the woman; and together they
    opened the door and went into the room. And
    what they saw when they were come into the
    room, Señor, was the most terrible sight that
    ever was seen in this world! For there, lying
    upon her bed, was that unhappy woman looking
    all distraught and agonized; and nailed
    fast to the feet and to the hands of her were the
    very same iron shoes that the blacksmith&mdash;who
    well knew his own forge-work&mdash;had nailed
    fast to the hoofs of the mule! Moreover, upon
    her body were the welts and the bruises left
    there when the blacks had beaten the mule
    with their cruel blows. And the woman,
    Señor, was as dead as she possibly could be.
    So they knew that what had happened was a
    divine punishment, and that the blacks were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> two devils who had changed the woman into a
    mule and so had taken her to be shod.</p>
<p>Perceiving, because of such a sign being
    given him, Señor, that he had committed an
    error, the master of that house of horror immediately
    went out from it&mdash;and at once disappeared
    completely and never was heard of
    again. As for the blacksmith, he was so pained
    by his share in the matter that always afterward,
    until the death of him, he was a very unhappy
    man. And that is the story of the
    Iron-shod Woman, Señor, from first to last.</p>

<h2><a name="LEGEND_OF_THE_ACCURSED_BELL6" id="LEGEND_OF_THE_ACCURSED_BELL6"></a>LEGEND OF THE ACCURSED BELL<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h2>
<p>This story, Señor&mdash;it is about the accursed
    bell that once was the clock-bell of the
    Palace&mdash;has so many beginnings that the only
    way really to get at the bones of it would be for
    a number of people, all talking at once, to tell
    the different first parts of it at the same time.</p>
<p>For, you see, the curse that was upon this
    bell&mdash;that caused it to be brought to trial
    before the Consejo of the Inquisition, and by
    the Consejo to be condemned to have its wicked
    tongue torn out and to be banished from Spain
    to this country&mdash;was made up of several curses
    which had been in use in other ways elsewhere
    previously: so that one beginning is with the
    Moor, and another with Don Gil de Marcadante,
    and another with the devil-forged
    armor, and still another with the loosing of
    all the curses from the cross (wherein for some
    hundreds of years they were imprisoned) and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> the fusing of them into the one great curse
    wherewith this unfortunate bell was afflicted&mdash;which
    happened when that holy emblem was
    refounded, and with the metal of it this bell
    was made.</p>
<p>Concerning the Moor, Señor, I can give you
    very little information. All that I know about
    him is that he had the bad name of Muslef; and
    that he was killed&mdash;as he deserved to be killed,
    being an Infidel&mdash;by a Christian knight; and
    that this knight cut his head off and brought it
    home with him as an agreeable memento of the
    occasion, and was very pleased with what he
    had done. Unfortunately, this knight also
    brought home with him the Moor's armor&mdash;which
    was of bronze, and so curiously and so
    beautifully wrought that it evidently had been
    forged by devils, and which was farther charged
    with devilishness because it had been worn by
    an Infidel; and then, still more unfortunately,
    he neglected to have the armor purified by
    causing the devils to be exorcised out of it by a
    Christian priest. Therefore, of course, the
    devils remained in the armor&mdash;ready to make
    trouble whenever they got the chance.</p>
<p>How Don Gil de Marcadante came to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> owner of that accursed devil-possessed armor,
    Señor, I never have heard mentioned. Perhaps
    he bought it because it happened to fit him;
    and, certainly&mdash;he being a most unusually sinful
    young gentleman&mdash;the curse that was upon
    it and the devils which were a part of it fitted
    him to a hair.</p>
<p>This Don Gil was a student of law in Toledo;
    but his studies were the very last things to
    which he turned his attention, and the life
    that he led was the shame of his respectable
    brother and his excellent mother's despair.
    Habitually, he broke every law of the Decalogue,
    and so brazenly that all the city rang with the
    stories of his evil doings and his crimes. Moreover,
    he was of a blusterous nature and a born
    brawler: ready at the slightest contradiction
    to burst forth with such a torrent of blasphemies
    and imprecations that his mouth seemed
    to be a den of snakes and toads and scorpions;
    and ever quick to snatch his sword out and to
    get on in a hurry from words to blows. As his
    nearest approach to good nature was after he
    had killed some one in a quarrel of his own
    making, and as even at those favorable times
    his temper was of a brittleness, he was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> looked upon as an agreeable companion and had
    few friends.</p>
<p>This Don Gil had most intimate relations
    with the devil, as was proved in various ways.
    Thus, a wound that he received in one of his
    duels instantly closed and healed itself; on a
    night of impenetrable darkness, as he went
    about his evil doings, he was seen to draw
    apart the heavy gratings of a window as though
    the thick iron bars had been silken threads;
    and a stone that he cast at a man in one of his
    rages&mdash;mercifully not hitting him&mdash;remained
    burning hot in the place where it had fallen for
    several days. Moreover, it was known generally
    that in the night time, in a very secret and
    hidden part of his dwelling, he gave himself up
    to hideous and most horrible sacrileges in
    which his master the devil had always a part.
    And so these facts&mdash;and others of a like nature&mdash;coming
    to the knowledge of the Holy Office,
    it was perceived that he was a sorcerer. Therefore
    he was marched off&mdash;wearing his devil-forged
    armor, to which fresh curses had come
    with his use of it&mdash;to a cell in the Inquisition;
    and to make sure of holding him fast until the
    next auto de fé came round, when he was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> be burned properly and regularly, he was bound
    with a great chain, and the chain was secured
    firmly to a strong staple in the cell wall.</p>
<p>But the devil, Señor, sometimes saves his
    own. On a morning, the jailer went as usual
    to Don Gil's cell with the bread and the water
    for him; and when he had opened the cell door
    he saw, as he believed, Don Gil in his armor
    waiting as usual for his bread and his water:
    but in a moment he perceived that what he
    saw was not Don Gil in his armor, but only the
    accursed armor standing upright full of emptiness;
    and that the staple was torn out; and
    that the great chain was broken; and that Don
    Gil was gone! And then&mdash;so much to the
    horror of the jailer that he immediately went
    mad of it&mdash;the empty armor began slowly to
    walk up and down the cell!</p>
<p>After that time Don Gil never was seen, nor
    was he heard of, again on earth; and so on
    earth, when the time came for burning him
    at the auto de fé, he had to be burned in
    effigy. However&mdash;as there could be no doubt
    about the place to which the devil had taken
    him&mdash;everybody was well satisfied that he got
    his proper personal burning elsewhere.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>
<p>Then it was, Señor, that the Holy Office
    most wisely ordered that that devil-possessed
    and doubly accursed armor should be melted,
    and refounded into a cross: knowing that the
    sanctity of that blessed emblem would quiet
    the curses and would hold the devils still and
    fast. Therefore that order was executed; and
    the wisdom of it&mdash;which some had questioned,
    on the ground that devils and curses were unsuitable
    material to make a cross of&mdash;was
    apparent as soon as the bronze turned fluid in
    the furnace: because there came from the
    fiery seething midst of it&mdash;to the dazed terror
    of the workmen&mdash;shouts of devil-laughter,
    and imprecations horrible to listen to, and
    frightful blasphemies; and to these succeeded,
    as the metal was being poured into the mould,
    a wild outburst of defiant remonstrance; and
    then all this demoniac fury died away&mdash;as the
    metal hardened and became fixed as a cross&mdash;at
    first into half-choked cries of agony, and
    then into confused lamentations, and at the
    last into little whimpering moans. Thus the
    devils and the curses were disposed of: and
    then the cross&mdash;holding them imprisoned in its
    holy substance&mdash;was set up in a little townlet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> not far from Madrid in which just then a cross
    happened to be wanted; and there it remained
    usefully for some hundreds of years.</p>
<p>At the end of that period&mdash;by which time
    everybody was dead who knew what was inside
    of it&mdash;the cross was asked for by the Prior
    of a little convent in that townlet near Madrid,
    who desired it that he might have it refounded
    into a bell; and as the Prior was a worthy
    person, and as he really needed a bell, his request
    was granted. So they made out of the
    cross a very beautiful bell: having on one side
    of it the two-headed eagle; and having on the
    other side of it a calvario; and having at the
    top of it, for its hanging, two imperial lions
    supporting a cross-bar in the shape of a crown.
    Then it was hung in the tower of the little
    convent; and the Prior, and all the Brothers
    with him, were very much pleased. But that
    worthy Prior, and those equally worthy Brothers,
    were not pleased for long, Señor: because
    the curses and the devils all were loose again&mdash;and
    their chance to do new wickednesses had
    come!</p>
<p>On a night of blackness, without any warning
    whatever, the whole of the townlet was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> awakened by the prodigious clangor of a bell
    furiously ringing. In an instant&mdash;seeking the
    cause of this disturbance&mdash;everybody came out
    into the night's blackness: the Señor Cura, the
    Señor Alcalde, the alguaciles, the Prior, the
    Brothers, all the townsfolk to the very last one.
    And when they had looked about them they
    found that the cause of the disturbance was the
    new bell of the convent: which was ringing with
    such an excessive violence that the night's
    blackness was corrupted with its noise.</p>
<p>Terror was upon everyone; and greater terror
    was upon every one when it was found out that
    the door of the bell-tower was locked, and that
    the bell was ringing of its lone self: because the
    bad fact then became evident that only devils
    could have the matter in hand. The Señor
    Alcalde alone&mdash;being a very valiant gentleman,
    and not much believing in devils&mdash;was not
    satisfied with that finding. Therefore the
    Señor Alcalde caused the door to be unlocked
    and, carrying a torch with him, entered the
    bell-tower; and there he found the bell-rope
    crazily flying up and down as though a dozen
    men were pulling it, and nobody was pulling
    it&mdash;which sight somewhat shook his nerves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> However, because of his valorousness, he only
    stopped to cross himself; and then he went on
    bravely up the belfry stair. But what he saw
    when he was come into the belfry fairly brought
    him to a stand. For there was the bell ringing
    tempestuously; and never a visible hand was
    near it; and the only living thing that he found
    in the belfry was a great black cat with its tail
    bushed out and its fur bristling&mdash;which evil
    animal for a moment leered at him malignantly,
    with its green eyes gleaming in the torch-light,
    and then sprang past him and dashed down the
    stair.</p>
<p>Then the Señor Alcalde, no longer doubting
    that the bell was being rung by devils, and himself
    not knowing how to manage devils, called
    down from the belfry to the Señor Cura to come
    up and take charge of the matter: whereupon
    the Señor Cura, holding his courage in both
    hands, did come up into the belfry, bringing his
    hisopo with him, and fell to sprinkling the bell
    with holy water&mdash;which seemed to him, so far
    as he could see his way into that difficult
    tangle, the best thing that he could do. But
    his doing it, of course, was the very worst thing
    that he could have done: because, you see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> Señor, the devils were angered beyond all endurance
    by being scalded with the holy water
    (that being the effect that holy water has upon
    devils) and so only rang the bell the more
    furiously in their agony of pain. Then the
    Señor Alcalde and the Señor Cura perceived
    that they could not quiet the devils, and decided
    to give up trying to. Therefore they came
    down from the belfry together&mdash;and they, and
    everybody with them, went away through the
    night's blackness crossing themselves, and were
    glad to be safe again in their homes.</p>
<p>The next day the Señor Alcalde made a
    formal inquest into the whole matter: citing
    to appear before him all the townsfolk and all
    the Brothers, and questioning them closely
    every one. And the result of this inquest was
    to make certain that the bell-ringer of the convent
    had not rung the bell; nor had any other
    of the Brothers rung it; nor had any of the
    townsfolk rung it. Therefore the Señor Alcalde,
    and with him the Señor Cura&mdash;whose opinion
    was of importance in such a matter&mdash;decided
    that the devil had rung it: and their decision
    was accepted by everybody, because that was
    what everybody from the beginning had believed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<p>Therefore&mdash;because such devilish doings affected
    the welfare of the whole kingdom&mdash;a
    formal report of all that had happened was submitted
    to the Cortes; and the Cortes, after
    pondering the report seriously, perceived that
    the matter was ecclesiastical and referred it
    to the Consejo of the Inquisition; and the members
    of the Consejo, in due course, ordered that
    all the facts should be digested and regularized
    and an opinion passed upon them by their
    Fiscal.</p>
<p>Being a very painstaking person, the Fiscal
    went at his work with so great an earnestness
    that for more than a year he was engaged upon
    it. First he read all that he could find to read
    about bells in all the Spanish law books, from
    the <cite>Siete Partidas</cite> of Alonzo the Wise downward;
    then he read all that he could find about bells
    in such law books of foreign countries as were
    accessible to him; then, in the light of the information
    so obtained, he digested and regularized
    the facts of the case presented for his
    consideration and applied himself to writing
    his opinion upon them; and then, at last, he
    came before the Consejo and read to that body
    his opinion from beginning to end. Through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> the whole of a long day the Fiscal read his
    opinion; and through the whole of the next day,
    and the next, and the next; and at the end of
    the fourth day he finished the reading of his
    opinion and sat down. And the opinion of the
    Fiscal was that the devil had rung the bell.</p>
<p>Then the Consejo, after debating for three
    days upon what had been read by the Fiscal,
    gave formal approval to his opinion; and in
    conformity with it the Consejo came to these
    conclusions:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>1. That the ringing of the bell was a matter
        of no importance to good Christians.</p>
    <p>2. That the bell, being possessed of a devil,
        should have its tongue torn out: so that never
        again should it dare to ring of its lone devilish
        self, to the peril of human souls.</p>
    <p>3. That the bell, being dangerous to good
        Christians, should be banished from the Spanish
        Kingdom to the Indies, and forever should
        remain tongueless and exiled over seas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thereupon, that wise sentence was executed.
    The devil-possessed bell was taken down from
    the belfry of the little convent, and its wicked
    tongue was torn out of it; then it was carried
    shamefully and with insults to the coast; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> it was put on board of one of the ships of the
    flota bound for Mexico; and in Mexico, in due
    course, it arrived. Being come here, and no
    orders coming with it regarding its disposition,
    it was brought from Vera Cruz to the Capital
    and was placed in an odd corner of one of the
    corridors of the Palace: and there it remained
    quietly&mdash;everybody being shy of meddling
    with a bell that was known to be alive with
    witchcraft&mdash;for some hundreds of years.</p>
<p>In that same corner it still was, Señor, when
    the Conde de Revillagigedo&mdash;only a little more
    than a century ago&mdash;became Viceroy; and as
    soon as that most energetic gentleman saw it
    he wanted to know in a hurry&mdash;being indisposed
    to let anything or anybody rust in idleness&mdash;why
    a bell that needed only a tongue in
    it to make it serviceable was not usefully employed.
    For some time no one could tell him
    anything more about the bell than that there
    was a curse upon it; and that answer did not
    satisfy him, because curses did not count for
    much in his very practical mind. In the end
    a very old clerk in the Secretariat gave him the
    bell's true story; and proved the truth of it by
    bringing out from deep in the archives an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> ancient yellowed parchment: which was precisely
    the royal order, following the decree of
    the Consejo, that the bell should have its tongue
    torn out, and forever should remain tongueless
    and exiled over seas.</p>
<p>With that order before him, even the Conde
    de Revillagigedo, Señor, did not venture to have
    a new tongue put into the bell and to set it to
    regular work again; but what he did do came
    to much the same thing. At that very time he
    was engaged in pushing to a brisk completion
    the repairs to the Palace&mdash;that had gone on for
    a hundred years languishingly, following the
    burning of it in the time of the Viceroy Don
    Gaspar de la Cerda&mdash;and among his repairings
    was the replacement of the Palace clock. Now
    a clock-bell, Señor, does not need a tongue in
    it, being struck with hammers from the outside;
    and so the Conde, whose wits were of an
    alertness, perceived in a moment that by employing
    the bell as a clock-bell he could make
    it useful again without traversing the king's
    command. And that was what immediately
    he did with it&mdash;and that was how the Palace
    clock came to have foisted upon it this accursed
    bell.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<p>But, so far as I have heard, Señor, this bell
    conducted itself as a clock-bell with a perfect
    regularity and propriety: probably because the
    devils which were in it had grown too old to be
    dangerously hurtful, and because the curse
    that was upon it had weakened with time.
    I myself, as a boy and as a young man, have
    heard it doing its duty always punctually;
    and no doubt it still would be doing its duty
    had not the busybodying French seen fit&mdash;during
    the period of the Intervention, when
    they meddled with everything&mdash;to put another
    bell in the place of it and to have it melted
    down. What was done with the metal when
    the bell was melted, Señor, I do not know; but
    I have been told by an old founder of my
    acquaintance that nothing was done with it:
    because, as he very positively assured me,
    when the bell was melted the metal of it went
    sour in the furnace and refused to be recast.</p>
<p>If that is true, Señor, it looks as though all
    those devils in the bell&mdash;which came to it
    from the Moor and from the devil-forged
    armor and from Don Gil de Marcadante&mdash;still
    had some strength for wickedness left to them
    even in their old age.</p>

<h2><a name="LEGEND_OF_THE_CALLEJON_DEL" id="LEGEND_OF_THE_CALLEJON_DEL"></a>LEGEND OF THE CALLEJÓN DEL
    PADRE LECUONA<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></h2>
<p>Who Padre Lecuona was, Señor, and what
    he did or had done to him in this street
    that caused his name to be given to it, I do
    not know. The Padre about whom I now am
    telling you, who had this strange thing happen
    to him in this street, was named Lanza; but he
    was called by everybody Lanchitas&mdash;according
    to our custom of giving such endearing diminutives
    to the names of those whom we love.
    He deserved to be loved, this excellent Padre
    Lanchitas: because he himself loved everybody,
    and freely gave to all in sickness or in
    trouble his loving aid. Confessing to him was
    a pleasure; and his absolution was worth
    having, because it was given always with the
    approval of the good God. My own grandfather
    knew him well, Señor, having known a
    man who had seen him when he was a boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> Therefore this strange story about him is
    true.</p>
<p>On a night&mdash;and it was a desponding night,
    because rain was falling and there was a chill
    wind&mdash;Padre Lanchitas was hurrying to the
    house of a friend of his, where every week he and
    three other gentlemen of a Friday evening played
    malilla together. It is a very serious game,
    Señor, and to play it well requires a large mind.
    He was late, and that was why he was hurrying.</p>
<p>When he was nearly come to the house of his
    friend&mdash;and glad to get there because of the
    rain and the cold&mdash;he was stopped by an old
    woman plucking at his wet cloak and speaking
    to him. And the old woman begged him for
    God's mercy to come quickly and confess a
    dying man. Now that is a call, Señor, that a
    priest may not refuse; but because his not
    joining them would inconvenience his friends,
    who could not play at their game of malilla
    without him, he asked the woman why she did
    not go to the parish priest of the parish in which
    the dying man was. And the woman answered
    him that only to him would the dying
    man confess; and she begged him again for
    God's mercy to hurry with her, or the confession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> would not be made in time&mdash;and then
    the sin of his refusal would be heavy on his
    own soul when he himself came to die.</p>
<p>So, then, the Padre went with her, walking
    behind her along the cold dark streets in the
    mud with the rain falling; and at last she
    brought him to the eastern end of this street
    that is called the Callejón del Padre Lecuona,
    and to the long old house there that faces toward
    the church of El Carmen and has a hump in
    the middle on the top of its front wall. It is
    a very old house, Señor. It was built in the
    time when we had Viceroys, instead of the
    President Porfírio; and it has no windows&mdash;only
    a great door for the entering of carriages at
    one end of it, and a small door in the middle of
    it, and another small door at the other end. A
    person who sells charcoal, Señor, lives there now.</p>
<p>It was to the middle door that the woman
    brought Padre Lanchitas. The door was not
    fastened, and at a touch she pushed it open
    and in they went together&mdash;and the first thing
    that the Padre noticed when he was come
    through the doorway was a very bad smell.
    It was the sort of smell, Señor, that is found in
    very old houses of which all the doors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> windows have been shut fast for a very long
    time. But the Padre had matters more important
    than bad smells to attend to, and all
    that he did about it was to hold his handkerchief
    close to his nose. One little poor
    candle, stuck on a nail in a board, was set in a
    far corner; and in another corner was a man
    lying on a mat spread upon the earth floor; and
    there was nothing else whatever&mdash;excepting
    cobwebs everywhere, and the bad smell, and
    the old woman, and the Padre himself&mdash;in that
    room.</p>
<p>That he might see him whom he was to
    confess, Padre Lanchitas took the candle in
    his hand and went to the man on the mat and
    pulled aside the ragged and dirty old blanket
    that covered him; and then he started back
    with a very cold qualm in his stomach, saying
    to the woman: &quot;This man already is dead! He
    cannot confess! And he has the look of having
    been dead for a very long while!&quot; And that
    was true, Señor&mdash;for what he saw was a dry
    and bony head, with yellow skin drawn tight
    over it, having shut eyes deep sunken. Also,
    the two hands which rested crossed upon the
    man's breast were no more than the same dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> yellow skin shrunk close over shrunken bones!
    And, seeing such a bad strange sight, the
    Padre was uneasy and alarmed.</p>
<p>But the woman said back to him with assurance,
    yet also coaxingly: &quot;This man is
    going to confess, Padrecito&quot;&mdash;and, so speaking,
    she fetched from its far corner the board
    with the nail in it, and took the candle from
    him and set it fast again upon the nail. And
    then the man himself, in the light and in the
    shadow, sat up on the mat and began to recite
    in a voice that had a rusty note in it the
    Confiteor Deo&mdash;and after that, of course, there
    was nothing for the Padre to do but to listen
    to him till the end.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 529px;"> <img src="images/illus-121.jpg" width="529" height="800" alt="" /> <span class="caption">EL CALLEJÓN DEL PADRE LECVONA</span> </div>
<p>What he told, Señor, being told under the
    seal of confession, of course remained always
    a secret. But it was known, later, that he
    spoke of matters which had happened a good
    two hundred years back&mdash;as the Padre knew
    because he was a great reader of books of history;
    and that he put himself into the very
    middle of those matters and made the terrible
    crime that he had committed a part of them;
    and that he ended by telling that in that
    ancient time he had been killed in a brawl suddenly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> and so had died unconfessed and unshriven,
    and that ever since his soul had blistered
    in hell.</p>
<p>Hearing such wild talk from him, the Padre
    was well satisfied that the poor man's wits were
    wandering in his fever&mdash;as happens with many,
    Señor, in their dying time&mdash;and so bade him
    lie quietly and rest himself; and promised that
    he would come to him and hear his confession
    later on.</p>
<p>But the man cried out very urgently that
    that must not be: declaring that by God's
    mercy he had been given one single chance to
    come back again out of Eternity to confess his
    sins and to be shriven of them; and that unless
    the Padre did hearken then and there to the
    confession of his sins, and did shrive him of
    them, this one chance that God's mercy had
    given him would be lost and wasted&mdash;and
    back he would go forever to the hot torments
    of hell.</p>
<p>Therefore the Padre&mdash;being sure, by that
    time, that the man was quite crazy in his
    fever&mdash;let him talk on till he had told the whole
    story of his frightful sinnings; and then did
    shrive him, to quiet him&mdash;just as you promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> the moon to a sick, fretful child. And the
    devil must have been very uneasy that night,
    Señor, because the good nature of that kind-hearted
    priest lost to him what by rights was
    his own!</p>
<p>As Padre Lanchitas spoke the last words of
    the absolution, the man fell back again on his
    mat with a sharp crackling sound like that of
    dry bones rattling; and the woman had left
    the room; and the candle was sputtering out its
    very last sparks. Therefore the Padre went
    out in a hurry through the still open door into
    the street; and no sooner had he come there
    than the door closed behind him sharply, as
    though some one on the inside had pushed
    against it strongly to shut it fast.</p>
<p>Out in the street he had expected to find the
    old woman waiting for him; and he looked
    about for her everywhere, desiring to tell her
    that she must send for him when the man's
    fever left him&mdash;that he might return and hear
    from the man a real confession, and really
    shrive him of his sins. But the old woman was
    quite gone. Thinking that she must have
    slipped past him in the darkness into the house,
    he knocked at the door lightly, and then loudly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> but no answer came to his knocking&mdash;and
    when he tried to push the door open, using all
    his strength, it held fast against his pushing as
    firmly as though it had been a part of the stone
    wall.</p>
<p>So the Padre, having no liking for standing
    there in the cold and rain uselessly, hurried
    onward to his friend's house&mdash;and was glad
    to get into the room where his friends were
    waiting for him, and where plenty of candles
    were burning, and where it was dry and warm.</p>
<p>He had walked so fast that his forehead was
    wet with sweat when he took his hat off, and
    to dry it he put his hand into his pocket for his
    handkerchief; but his handkerchief was not in
    his pocket&mdash;and then he knew that he must
    have dropped it in the house where the dying
    man lay. It was not just a common handkerchief,
    Señor, but one very finely embroidered&mdash;having
    the letters standing for his name
    worked upon it, with a wreath around them&mdash;that
    had been made for him by a nun of his
    acquaintance in a convent of which he was the
    almoner; and so, as he did not at all like to lose
    it, he sent his friend's servant to that old house
    to get it back again. After a good long while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> the servant returned: telling that the house
    was shut fast, and that one of the watch&mdash;seeing
    him knocking at the door of it&mdash;had told
    him that to knock there was only to wear out
    his knuckles, because no one had lived in that
    house for years and years!</p>
<p>All of this, as well as all that had gone
    before it, was so strange and so full of mystery,
    that Padre Lanchitas then told to his three
    friends some part of what that evening had
    happened to him; and it chanced that one of
    the three was the notary who had in charge
    the estate of which that very house was a part.
    And the notary gave Padre Lanchitas his true
    word for it that the house&mdash;because of some
    entangling law matters&mdash;had stood locked fast
    and empty for as much as a lifetime; and he
    declared that Padre Lanchitas must be mixing
    that house with some other house&mdash;which
    would be easy, since all that had happened had
    been in the rainy dark. But the Padre, on his
    side, was sure that he had made no mistake in
    the matter; and they both got a little warm in
    their talk over it; and they ended by agreeing&mdash;so
    that they might come to a sure settlement&mdash;to
    meet at that old house, and the notary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> bring with him the key of it, on the morning
    of the following day.</p>
<p>So they did meet there, Señor, and they went
    to the middle door&mdash;the one that had opened
    at a touch from the old woman's hand. But
    all around that door, as the notary bade Padre
    Lanchitas observe before they opened it, were
    unbroken cobwebs; and the keyhole was choked
    with the dust that had blown into it, little by
    little, in the years that had passed since it had
    known a key. And the other two doors of the
    house were just the same. However, Padre
    Lanchitas would not admit, even with that
    proof against him, that he was mistaken; and
    the notary, smiling at him but willing to satisfy
    him, picked out the dust from the keyhole and
    got the key into it and forced back hardly the
    rusty bolt of the lock&mdash;and together they went
    inside.</p>
<p>Coming from the bright sunshine into that
    dusky place&mdash;lighted only from the doorway,
    and the door but part way open because it was
    loose on its old hinges and stuck fast&mdash;they
    could see at first nothing more than that the
    room was empty and bare. What they did
    find, though&mdash;and the Padre well remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> it&mdash;was the bad smell. But the notary said
    that just such bad smells were in all old shut-up
    houses, and it proved nothing; while the cobwebs
    and the closed keyhole did prove most
    certainly that Padre Lanchitas had not entered
    that house the night before&mdash;and that
    nobody had entered it for years and years. To
    what the notary said there was nothing to be
    answered; and the Padre&mdash;not satisfied, but
    forced to give in to such strong proof that he
    was mistaken&mdash;was about to come away out of
    the house, and so have done with it. But just
    then, Señor, he made a very wonderful and
    horrifying discovery. By that time his eyes
    had grown accustomed to the shadows; and so
    he saw over in one corner&mdash;lying on the floor
    close beside where the man had lain whose
    confession he had taken&mdash;a glint of something
    whitish. And, Señor, it was his very own handkerchief
    that he had lost!</p>
<p>That was enough to satisfy even the notary;
    and as nothing more was to be done there they
    came out, and gladly, from that bad dark place
    into the sunshine. As for Padre Lanchitas,
    Señor, he was all mazed and daunted&mdash;knowing
    then the terrible truth that he had confessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> a dead man; and, what was worse, that
    he had given absolution to a sinful soul come
    hot to him from hell! He held his hat in his
    hand as he came out from the house&mdash;and
    never did he put it on again: bareheaded he
    went thenceforward until the end of his days!
    He was a very good man, and his life had been
    always a very holy life; but from that time on,
    till the death of him, he made it still holier
    by his prayings and his fastings and his endless
    helpings of the poorest of the poor. At last
    he died. And it is said, Señor, that in the
    walls of that old house they found dead men's
    bones.</p>

<h2><a name="LEGEND_OF_THE_LIVING_SPECTRE8" id="LEGEND_OF_THE_LIVING_SPECTRE8"></a>LEGEND OF THE LIVING SPECTRE<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></h2>
<p>Apparitions of dead people, Señor, of
    course are numerous and frequent. I myself&mdash;as
    on other occasions I have mentioned
    to you&mdash;have seen several spectres, and so
    have various of my friends. But this spectre
    of which I now am telling you&mdash;that appeared
    on the Plaza Mayor at noonday, and was seen
    by everybody&mdash;was altogether out of the ordinary:
    being not in the least a dead person,
    but a person who wore his own flesh and bones
    in the usual manner and was alive in them;
    yet who certainly was walking and talking
    here on the Plaza Mayor of this City of Mexico
    in the very self-same moment that he also was
    walking and talking in a most remote and
    wholly different part of the world. Therefore&mdash;in
    spite of his wearing his own flesh and bones
    in the usual manner and being alive in them&mdash;it
    was certain that he was a spectre: because it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> was certain that his journeying could have
    been made only on devils' wings. The day
    on which this marvel happened is known most
    exactly: because it happened on the day after
    the day that the Governor of the Filipinas,
    Don Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas, had his head
    murderously split open, and died of it, in the
    Molucca Islands; and that gentleman was
    killed in that bad manner on the 25th of October
    in the year 1593. Therefore&mdash;since everything
    concerning this most extraordinary happening
    is known with so great an accuracy&mdash;there
    can be no doubt whatever but that in
    every particular all that I now am telling you
    is strictly true.</p>
<p>Because it began in two different places at
    the same time, it is not easy to say certainly,
    Señor, which end of this story is the beginning
    of it; but the beginning of it is this: On a day,
    being the day that I have just named to you,
    the sentries on guard at the great doors of the
    Palace&mdash;and also the people who at that time
    happened to be walking near by on the Plaza
    Mayor&mdash;of a sudden saw an entirely strange
    sentry pacing his beat before the great doors
    of the Palace quite in the regular manner:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> marching back and forth, with his gun on his
    shoulder; making his turns with a soldierly
    propriety; saluting correctly those entitled to
    salutes who passed him; and in every way conducting
    himself as though he duly had been
    posted there&mdash;but making his marchings and
    his turnings and his salutings with a wondering
    look on the face of him, and having the air of
    one who is all bedazzled and bemazed.</p>
<p>What made every one know that he was a
    stranger in this City was that the uniform
    which he wore was of a wholly different cut
    and fabric from that belonging to any regiment
    at that time quartered here: being, in fact&mdash;as
    was perceived by one of the sentries who had
    served in the Filipinas&mdash;the uniform worn in
    Manila by the Palace Guard. He was a man
    of forty, or thereabouts; well set up and sturdy;
    and he had the assured carriage&mdash;even in his
    bedazzlement and bemazement&mdash;of an old
    soldier who had seen much campaigning, and
    who could take care of himself through any
    adventure in which he might happen to land.
    Moreover, his talk&mdash;when the time came for
    him to explain himself&mdash;went with a devil-may-care
    touch to it that showed him to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> man who even with witches and demons was
    quite ready to hold his own.</p>
<p>His explanation of himself, of course, was
    not long in coming: because the Captain of the
    Guard at once was sent for; and when the
    Captain of the Guard came he asked the
    stranger sentry most sharply what his name
    was, and where he came from, and what he was
    doing on a post to which he had not been
    assigned.</p>
<p>To these questions the stranger sentry made
    answer&mdash;speaking with an easy confidence, and
    not in the least ruffled by the Captain's sharpness
    with him&mdash;that his name was Gil Pérez;
    that he came from the Filipinas; and that what
    he was doing was his duty as near as he could
    come to it: because he had been duly detailed to
    stand sentry that morning before the Governor's
    Palace&mdash;and although this was not the
    Governor's Palace before which he had been
    posted it certainly was a governor's palace,
    and that he therefore was doing the best that
    he could do. And to these very curious statements
    he added&mdash;quite casually, as though referring
    to an ordinary matter of current interest&mdash;that
    the Governor of the Filipinas, Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas, had had his head
    murderously split open, and was dead of it, in
    the Molucca Islands the evening before.</p>
<p>Well, Señor, you may fancy what a nest of
    wasps was let loose when this Gil Pérez gave
    to the Captain of the Guard so incredible an
    account of himself; and, on top of it, told that
    the Governor of the Filipinas had been badly
    killed on the previous evening in islands in the
    Pacific Ocean thousands and thousands of
    miles away! It was a matter that the Viceroy
    himself had to look into. Therefore before the
    Viceroy&mdash;who at that time was the good Don
    Luis de Velasco&mdash;Gil Pérez was brought in a
    hurry: and to the Viceroy he told over again
    just the same story, in just the same cool
    manner, and in just the same words.</p>
<p>Very naturally, the Viceroy put a great many
    keen questions to him; and to those questions
    he gave his answers&mdash;or said plainly that he
    could not give any answers&mdash;with the assured
    air of an old soldier who would not lightly suffer
    his word to be doubted even by a Viceroy;
    and who was ready, in dealing with persons
    of less consequence, to make good his sayings
    with his fists or with his sword.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<p>In part, his explanation of himself was
    straightforward and satisfactory. What he
    told about the regiment to which he belonged
    was known to be true; and equally known to
    be true was much of what he told&mdash;being in
    accord with the news brought thence by the
    latest galleon&mdash;about affairs in the Filipinas.
    But when it came to explaining the main
    matter&mdash;how he had been shifted across the
    ocean and the earth, and all in a single moment,
    from his guard-mount before the Governor's
    Palace in Manila to his guard-mount before
    the Viceroy's Palace in the City of Mexico&mdash;Gil
    Pérez was at a stand. How that strange
    thing had happened, he said, he knew no more
    than Don Luis himself knew. All that he
    could be sure of was that it <em>had</em> happened:
    because, certainly, only a half hour earlier he
    had been in Manila; and now, just as certainly,
    he was in the City of Mexico&mdash;as his lordship
    the Viceroy could see plainly with his own
    eyes. As to the even greater marvel&mdash;how
    he knew that on the previous evening the
    Governor of the Filipinas had had his head
    murderously split open, and was dead of it,
    in the Molucca Islands&mdash;he said quite freely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> that he did not in the least know how he knew
    it. What alone he could be sure of, he said,
    was that in his heart he did know that Don
    Gómez had been killed on the previous evening
    in that bad manner; and he very stoutly
    asserted that the truth of what he told would
    be clear to Don Luis, and to everybody, when
    the news of the killing of Don Gómez had had
    time to get to Mexico in the ordinary way.</p>
<p>And then Gil Pérez&mdash;having answered all
    of the Viceroy's questions which he could
    answer, and having said all that he had to say&mdash;stood
    quite at his ease before the Viceroy:
    with his feet firmly planted, and his right hand
    on his hip, and his right arm akimbo&mdash;and so
    waited for whatever might happen to be the
    next turn.</p>
<p>Well, Señor, the one thing of which anybody
    really could be sure in this amazing matter&mdash;and
    of which, of course, everybody was sure&mdash;was
    that the devil was at both the bottom and
    the top of it; and, also, there seemed to be very
    good ground for believing that Gil Pérez was in
    much closer touch with the devil than any
    good Christian&mdash;even though he were an old
    soldier, and not much in the way of Christianity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> expected of him&mdash;had any right to be.
    Therefore the Viceroy rid himself of an affair
    that was much the same to him as a basket of
    nettles by turning Gil Pérez over to the Holy
    Office&mdash;and off he was carried to Santo
    Domingo and clapped into one of the strongest
    cells.</p>
<p>Most men, of course, on finding themselves
    that way in the clutches of the Inquisition,
    would have had all the insides of them filled
    with terror; but Gil Pérez, Señor&mdash;being, as I
    have mentioned, an old campaigner&mdash;took it
    all as it came along to him and was not one bit
    disturbed. He said cheerfully that many times
    in the course of his soldiering he had been
    in much worse places; and added that&mdash;having
    a good roof over his head, and quite
    fair rations, and instead of marching and fighting
    only to sit at his ease and enjoy himself&mdash;he
    really was getting, for once in his life,
    as much of clear comfort as any old soldier had
    a right to expect would come his way. Moreover,
    in his dealings with the Familiars of the
    Holy Office his conduct was exemplary. He
    stuck firmly to his assertion that&mdash;whatever
    the devil might have had to do with him&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> never had had anything to do with the devil;
    he seemed to take a real pleasure in confessing
    as many of his sins as he conveniently could
    remember; and in every way that was open to
    him his conduct was that of quite as good a
    Christian as any old soldier reasonably could
    be expected to be.</p>
<p>Therefore&mdash;while he staid on in his cell very
    contentedly&mdash;the Familiars of the Holy Office
    put their heads together and puzzled and
    puzzled as to what they should do with him:
    because it certainly seemed as though the
    devil, to suit his own devilish purposes, simply
    had made a convenience of Gil Pérez without
    getting his consent in the matter; and so it
    did not seem quite fair&mdash;in the face of his protest
    that he was as much annoyed as anybody
    was by what the devil had done with him&mdash;to
    put him into a flame-covered sanbenito, and
    to march him off to be burned for a sorcerer at
    the next auto de fé. Therefore the Familiars
    of the Holy Office kept on putting their heads
    together and puzzling and puzzling as to what
    they should do with him; and Gil Pérez kept
    on enjoying himself in his cell in Santo Domingo&mdash;and
    so the months went on and on.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>
<p>And then, on a day, a new turn was given
    to the whole matter: when the galleon from
    the Filipinas arrived at Acapulco and brought
    with it the proof that every word that Gil
    Pérez had spoken was true. Because the
    galleon brought the news that Don Gómez
    Pérez Dasmariñas&mdash;the crew of the ship that
    he was on having mutinied&mdash;really had had
    his head murderously split open, and was
    dead of it, in the Molucca Islands; and that this
    bad happening had come to him at the very
    time that Gil Pérez had named. Moreover,
    one of the military officers who had come from
    the Filipinas in the galleon, and up from
    Acapulco to the City of Mexico with the
    conducta, recognized Gil Pérez the moment
    that he laid eyes on him; and this officer said
    that he had seen him&mdash;only a day or two
    before the galleon's sailing&mdash;on duty in Manila
    with the Palace Guard. And so the fact was
    settled beyond all doubting that Gil Pérez had
    been brought by the devil from Manila to the
    City of Mexico; and, also, that the devil&mdash;since
    only the devil could have done it&mdash;had
    put the knowledge of the murderous killing of
    Don Gómez into his heart. Wherefore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> fact that Gil Pérez was in league with the devil
    was clear to all the world.</p>
<p>Then the Familiars of the Holy Office for the
    last time put their heads together and puzzled
    and puzzled over the matter; and at the end
    of their puzzling they decided that Gil Pérez
    was an innocent person, and that he undoubtedly
    had had criminal relations with the devil
    and was full of wickedness. Therefore they
    ordered that, being innocent, he should be set
    free from his cell in Santo Domingo; and that,
    being a dangerous character whose influence was
    corrupting, he should be sent back to Manila in
    the returning galleon. And that was their decree.</p>
<p>Gil Pérez, Señor, took that disposition of him
    in the same easy-going way that he had taken
    all the other dispositions of him: save that he
    grumbled a little&mdash;as was to be expected of an
    old soldier&mdash;over having to leave his comfortably
    idle life in his snug quarters and to go
    again to his fightings and his guard-mounts
    and his parades. And so back he went to the
    Filipinas: only his return journey was made in
    a slow and natural manner aboard the galleon&mdash;not,
    as his outward journey had been made,
    all in a moment on devils' wings.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<p>To my mind, Señor, it seems that there is
    more of this story that ought to be told. For
    myself, I should like to know why the Familiars
    of the Holy Office did not deal a little more
    severely with a case that certainly had the
    devil at both the bottom and the top of it;
    and, also, I should like to know what became
    of Gil Pérez when he got back to Manila in the
    galleon&mdash;and there had to tell over again about
    his relations with the devil in order to account
    for his half year's absence from duty without
    leave. But those are matters which I never
    have heard mentioned; and what I have told
    you is all that there is to tell.</p>

<h2><a name="LEGEND_OF_THE_CALLE_DE_LOS_PARADOS" id="LEGEND_OF_THE_CALLE_DE_LOS_PARADOS">LEGEND OF THE CALLE DE LOS PARADOS</a></h2>
<p>Two dead lovers, Señor, stand always
    in the Calle de los Parados, one at each
    end of it; and that is why&mdash;because they remain
    steadfastly on parade there, though it is not
    everybody who happens to see their yellow
    skeletons on those corners&mdash;the street of the
    Parados is so named.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 526px;"> <img src="images/illus-143.jpg" width="526" height="800" alt="" /> <span class="caption">LA CALLE DE LOS PARADOS</span> </div>
<p>As you may suppose, Señor, the lovers now
    being dry skeletons, what brought them there
    happened some time ago. Just when it happened,
    I do not know precisely; but it was when
    an excellent gentleman, who was an officer in
    the Royal Mint, lived in the fine house that
    is in the middle of the street on the south side
    of it, and had living with him a very beautiful
    daughter whose hair was like spun gold.
    This gentleman was named Don José de Vallejo
    y Hermosillo; and his daughter was named
    (because her mother was of the noble family of
    Vezca) Doña María Ysabel de Vallejo y Vezca;
    and she was of great virtue and sweetness, and
    was twenty-two years old.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>
<p>All the young men of the City sought her in
    marriage; but there were two who were more
    than any of the others in earnest about it.
    One of these was Don Francisco Puerto y
    Solis, a lieutenant of dragoons: who had to
    offer her only his good looks&mdash;he was a very
    handsome gentleman&mdash;and the hope of what
    he might get for himself with his sword. The
    other one was the Señor Don Antonio Miguel
    del Cardonal, Conde de Valdecebro&mdash;who also
    was a handsome gentleman, and who owned
    mills in Puebla of the Angels, and a very great
    hacienda, and was so rich that it was the whole
    business of two old notaries to count his gold.</p>
<p>And these two posted themselves every day
    in the street in which was Doña María's home&mdash;one
    at the corner of the Calle del Reloj, the
    other at the corner of the Calle de Santa Catarina&mdash;that
    they might look at her when she
    came forth from her house; and that she might
    see them waiting to get sight of her, and so
    know that they loved her. It was the same
    custom then, Señor, as it is to-day. In that
    way all of our polite young men make love.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<p>And just as our young ladies nowadays wait
    and wait and think and think before they
    make their hearts up, so Doña María waited
    and thought then&mdash;and the time slipped on
    and on, and neither the Lieutenant nor the
    Conde knew what was in her mind. Then
    there happened, Señor, a very dismal thing.
    A pestilence fell upon the City, and of that
    pestilence Doña María sickened and died. But
    it chanced that neither of her lovers was on
    his corner when they took her out from her
    house to bury her&mdash;you see, Señor, even lovers
    must eat and sleep sometimes, and they could
    not be always on their watch for her&mdash;and in
    that way it happened that neither of them
    knew that she was dead and gone. Therefore
    they kept on standing on their parade quite as
    usual&mdash;coming steadfastly to their corners day
    after day, and month after month, and year
    after year. And although, after a while, they
    died too, they still stood at their posts&mdash;just as
    though they and Doña María still were alive.
    And there, on their corners, they have remained
    until this very day.</p>

<p>It is told, Señor, that once in broad daylight
    half the City saw those honest waiting skeletons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> It was on a day when there was a great festival
    for the incoming of a new Viceroy, and they
    were seen by the crowd that waited in the
    atrium of the church of Santa Catarina to see
    the procession pass. But that was some
    hundreds of years ago, Señor. Now, for the
    most part, it is at night and by moonlight
    that they are seen. I have not happened to
    see them myself&mdash;but then I do not often go
    that way.</p>

<h2><a name="LEGEND_OF_THE_CALLE_DE_LA_JOYA" id="LEGEND_OF_THE_CALLE_DE_LA_JOYA">LEGEND OF THE CALLE DE LA JOYA</a></h2>
<p>What this street was called, in very old
    times, Señor, no one knows: because the
    dreadful thing that gave to it the name of the
    Street of the Jewel happened a long, long
    while ago. It was before the Independence.
    It was while the Viceroys were here who were
    sent by the King of Spain.</p>
<p>In those days there lived in this fine house
    at the corner of the Calle de Mesones and what
    since then has been called the Calle de la Joya&mdash;it
    is at the northwest corner, Señor, and a
    biscuit-bakery is on the lower floor&mdash;a very
    rich Spanish merchant: who was named Don
    Alonso Fernández de Bobadilla, and who was
    a tall and handsome man, and gentle-mannered,
    and at times given to fits of rage. He
    was married to a very rich and a very beautiful
    lady, who was named Doña Ysabel de la
    Garcide y Tovar; and she was the daughter of
    the Conde de Torreleal. This lady was of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> ardent and a wilful nature, but Don Alonso
    loved her with a sincerity and humored her in
    all her whims and wants. When they went
    abroad together&mdash;always in a grand coach,
    with servants like flies around them&mdash;the
    whole City stood still and stared!</p>
<p>Doña Ysabel was not worthy of her husband's
    love: and so he was told one day, by
    whom there was no knowing, in a letter that
    was thrown from the street into the room
    where he was sitting, on the ground floor. It
    was his office of affairs, Señor. It is one of the
    rooms where the biscuits are baked now. In
    that letter he was bidden to watch with care
    his wife's doings with the Licenciado Don
    José Raul de Lara, the Fiscal of the Inquisition&mdash;who
    was a forlorn little man (<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">hombrecillo</i>)
    not at all deserving of any lady's love&mdash;and
    Don Alonso did watch, and what came of his
    watching was a very terrible thing.</p>
<p>He pretended, Señor, that he had an important
    affair with the Viceroy that would
    keep him at the Palace until far into the night;
    and so went his way from his home in the early
    evening&mdash;but went no farther than a dozen
    paces from his own door. There, in the dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> street, huddled close into a doorway, his cloak
    around him&mdash;it was a night in winter&mdash;he
    waited in the creeping cold. After a time along
    came some one&mdash;he did not know who, but it
    was the Licenciado&mdash;and as he drew near to
    the house Doña Ysabel came out upon her
    balcony, and between them there passed a sign.
    Then, in a little while, the door of Don Alonso's
    house was opened softly and the Licenciado went
    in; and then, softly, the door was shut again.</p>
<p>Presently, Don Alonso also went in, holding
    in his hand his dagger. What he found&mdash;and
    it made him so angry that he fell into one of his
    accustomed fits of rage over it&mdash;was the
    Licenciado putting on the wrist of his wife a
    rich golden bracelet. When they saw him,
    Señor, their faces at once went white&mdash;and
    their faces remained white always: because
    Don Alonso, before the blood could come back
    again, had killed the two of them with his
    dagger&mdash;and they were white in death! Then
    Don Alonso did what gave to this street the
    name of the Street of the Jewel. From Doña
    Ysabel's wrist he wrenched loose the bracelet,
    and as he left the house he pinned it fast with
    his bloody dagger to the door.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>
<p>In that way things were found the next
    morning by the watch; and the watch, suspecting
    that something wrong had happened&mdash;because
    to see a bracelet and a bloody dagger
    in such a place was unusual&mdash;called the Alcalde
    to come and look into the matter; and the
    Alcalde, coming, found Doña Ysabel and the
    Licenciado lying very dead upon the floor.
    So the street was called the Calle de la Joya,
    and that is its name.</p>
<p>Don Alonso, Señor, was worried by what he
    had done, and became a Dieguino&mdash;it is the
    strict order of the Franciscans. They go barefoot&mdash;and
    it was in the convent of the Dieguinos,
    over there at the western end of the Alameda,
    that he ended his days.</p>

<h2><a name="LEGEND_OF_THE_CALLE_DE_LA" id="LEGEND_OF_THE_CALLE_DE_LA">LEGEND OF THE CALLE DE LA
    MACHINCUEPA</a></h2>
<p>Naturally, Señor, this matter which
    gave its name to the Calle de la Machincuepa
    created a scandal that set all the tongues
    in the City to buzzing about it: every one, of
    course, blaming the young lady&mdash;even though
    she did it to win such vast riches&mdash;for committing
    so publicly so great an impropriety;
    but some holding that a greater blame attached
    to the Marqués, her uncle, for punishing her&mdash;no
    matter how much she deserved punishment&mdash;by
    making her inheritance depend upon so
    strange and so outrageous a condition; and some
    even saying that the greatest blame of all rested
    upon the Viceroy: because he did not forbid an
    indecorum that was planned to&mdash;and that did&mdash;take
    place in the Plaza Mayor directly in
    front of his Palace, and so beneath his very
    nose. For myself, Señor, I think that the
    young lady deserved more blame than anybody:
    because she was free to make her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> choice in the matter, and that she chose riches
    rather than propriety very clearly proved&mdash;though
    that, to be sure, was known before she
    did her choosing&mdash;that she had a bad heart.
    As the Viceroy who did not forbid that young
    lady to do what she did do was the Duque
    de Linares&mdash;who, as you know, Señor, took
    up the duties of his high office in the year
    1714&mdash;you will perceive that the curious event
    about which I now am telling you occurred
    very nearly two full centuries ago.</p>
<p>At that time there lived in the street that
    ever since that time has been called the Street
    of the Machincuepa a very rich and a very
    noble Spanish gentleman whose name was Don
    Mendo Quiroga y Saurez, and whose title was
    Marqués del Valle Salado. In his beginning he
    was neither rich nor noble, and not even of
    good blood: having been begotten by an unknown
    father and born of an unknown mother;
    and having in his young manhood gone afloat
    out of Spain as a common sailor to seek his
    fortune on the sea. What he did upon the
    sea was a matter that his teeth guarded his
    tongue from talking about in his later years:
    but it was known generally that&mdash;while in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> appearance he and his ship had been engaged
    in the respectable business of bringing slaves
    from Africa to the colonies&mdash;his real business
    had been that of a corsair; and that on his
    murdering piracies the corner-stone of his great
    fortune had been laid.</p>
<p>Having in that objectionable manner accumulated
    a whole ship-load of money, and
    being arrived at an age when so bustling a life
    was distasteful to him, he came to Mexico;
    and, being come here, he bought with his ship-load
    of money the Valle Salado: and there he
    set up great salt-works out of which he coined
    more gold&mdash;knowing well how to grease the
    palms of those in the Government who could
    be of service to him&mdash;than could be guessed at
    even in a dream. Therefore it was known with
    certainty that he possessed a fortune of precisely
    three millions and a half of dollars&mdash;which
    is a greater sum, Señor, than a hundred men
    could count in a whole month of summer days.
    And of his millions he sent to the King such
    magnificent presents that the King, in simple
    justice to him, had to reward him; and so the
    King made him a marqués&mdash;and he was the
    Marqués del Valle Salado from that time on.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<p>Therefore&mdash;being so very rich, and a marqués&mdash;his
    sea-murderings of his younger days,
    and his sea-stealings that made the corner-stone
    of his great fortune, were the very last things
    which his teeth suffered his tongue to talk
    about: and he lived with a great magnificence
    a life that caused much scandal, and he was
    generally esteemed and respected, and because
    of his charities he was beloved by all the poor.</p>
<p>As old age began to creep upon this good
    gentleman, Señor, and with it the infirmities
    that came of his loose way of living, he found
    himself in the world lonely: because, you see&mdash;never
    having perceived any necessity for
    marrying&mdash;he had no wife to care for him, nor
    children whose duty it was to minister to his
    needs. Therefore&mdash;his brother in Spain about
    that time dying, and leaving a daughter behind
    him&mdash;he brought from Spain his dead
    brother's daughter, whom he put at the head
    of his magnificent household, and equally
    confided himself in his infirmity to her care.
    And, that she might be repaid for her care of
    him, he heaped upon her every possible luxury
    and splendor that his great riches could
    procure.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>
<p>The name of this young lady, Señor, was
    Doña Paz de Quiroga; and the position to
    which she was raised by Don Mendo's munificence&mdash;and
    all the more because she was
    raised to it from the depths of poverty&mdash;was
    very much to her mind. Doña Paz was of
    a great beauty that well became the rich clothing
    and the rich jewels that her uncle lavished
    upon her; and what with her beauty, and her
    finery, and her recognized nobility as the lawful
    inheritor of her uncle's title, she knew herself
    to be&mdash;and made no bones of asserting herself
    to be&mdash;the very greatest lady at the Viceroy's
    court. She was of a jealous and rancorous
    disposition, and very charitable, and excessively
    selfish, and her pride was beyond all words.
    Every one of the young men in the City immediately
    fell in love with her; and she won
    also the respect of the most eminent clerics
    and the homage of the very greatest nobles
    of the court. So nice was her sense of her own
    dignity that even in the privacy of her own
    household her conduct at all times was marked
    by a rigorous elegance; and in public she
    carried herself with a grave stateliness that
    would have befitted a queen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>
<p>But this young lady had a bad heart, Señor,
    as I have already mentioned; and toward Don
    Mendo, to whom she owed everything, she did
    not behave well at all. So far from ministering
    to him in his infirmities, she left him wholly
    to the care of hired servants; when she made
    her rare visits to his sick-room she carried
    always a scented kerchief, and held it to her
    nose closely&mdash;telling him that the smell of
    balsams and of plasters was distasteful to her;
    and never, by any chance whatever, did she
    give him one single kind look or kind word.
    As was most natural, Don Mendo did not like
    the way that Doña Paz treated him: therefore,
    in the inside of him, he made his mind up that
    he would pay her for it in the end. And in the
    end he did pay her for it: as she found out
    when, on a day, that worthy old man was
    called to go to heaven and they came to read
    his will.</p>
<p>Doña Paz listened to the reading of the will
    with the greatest satisfaction, Señor, until the
    reading got to the very end of it: because Don
    Mendo uniformly styled her his beloved niece&mdash;which
    somewhat surprised her&mdash;and in plain
    words directed that every one of his three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> millions and a half of dollars should be hers.
    But at the very end of the will a condition was
    made that had to be fulfilled before she could
    touch so much as a tlaco of her great inheritance:
    and that condition was so monstrous&mdash;and
    all the more monstrous because
    Doña Paz was so rigorously elegant in all her
    doings, and so respectful of her own dignity&mdash;that
    the mere naming of it almost suffocated
    her with fright and shame.</p>
<p>And, really, Señor, that Doña Paz felt that
    way about it is not be wondered at, because
    what Don Mendo put at the very end of his
    will was this: &quot;So to Paz, my beloved niece,
    I leave the whole of my possessions; but only
    in case that she comply precisely with the condition
    that I now lay upon her. And the condition
    that I now lay upon her is this: That,
    being dressed in her richest ball dress, and
    wearing her most magnificent jewels, she shall
    go in an open coach to the Plaza Mayor at
    noonday; and that, being come to the Plaza
    Mayor, she shall walk to the very middle of it;
    and that there, in the very middle of it, she
    shall bow her head to the ground; and that
    then, so bowing, she shall make the turn which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> among the common people of Mexico is called
    a 'machincuepa.' And it is my will that if my
    beloved niece Paz does not comply precisely
    with this condition, within six months from
    the day on which I pass out of life, then the
    whole of my possessions shall be divided into
    two equal parts: of which one part shall belong
    to the Convent of Nuestra Señora de la Merced,
    and the other part shall belong to the Convent
    of San Francisco; and of my possessions my
    beloved niece Paz shall have no part at all.
    And this condition I lay upon my beloved
    niece Paz that, in the bitterness of the shame
    of it, she may taste a little of the bitterness
    with which her cruelties have filled my dying
    years.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, Señor, you may fancy the state that
    that most proud and most dignified young lady
    was in when she knew the terms on which alone
    her riches would come to her! And as to making
    her mind up in such a case, she found it
    quite impossible. On the one side, she would
    say to herself that what was required of her to
    win her inheritance would be done, and done
    with, in no more than a moment; and that then
    and always&mdash;being rich beyond dreaming, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> in her own right a marquésa&mdash;she would be the
    greatest lady in the whole of New Spain. And
    then, on the other side, she would say to herself
    that precisely because of her great wealth and
    her title she would be all the more sneered at
    for descending to an act so scandalous; and that
    if she did descend to that act she would be
    known as the Marquésa de la Machincuepa to
    the end of her days. And what to do, Señor,
    she did not know at all. And as time went on
    and on, and she did not do anything, the
    Mercedarios and the Franciscanos&mdash;being always
    more and more sure that they would share
    between them Don Mendo's great fortune&mdash;talked
    pleasantly about new altars in their
    churches and new comforts in their convents:
    and as they talked they rubbed their
    hands.</p>
<p>And so it came to the very last day of the
    six months that Don Mendo had given to
    Doña Paz in which to make her mind up; and
    the morning hours of that day went slipping
    past, and of Doña Paz the crowds that filled
    the streets and the Plaza Mayor saw nothing;
    and the Mercedarios and the Franciscanos all
    had smiling faces&mdash;being at last entirely certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> that Don Mendo's millions of dollars would be
    theirs.</p>
<p>And then, Señor, just as the Palace clock
    was striking the half hour past eleven, the great
    doors of Don Mendo's house were opened;
    and out through the doorway came an open
    coach in which Doña Paz was seated, dressed
    in her richest ball dress and wearing the most
    magnificent of her jewels; and Doña Paz,
    pale as a dead woman, drove through the
    crowds on the streets and into the crowd on
    the Plaza Mayor; and then she walked, the
    crowd making way for her, to the very middle
    of it&mdash;where her servants had laid a rich carpet
    for her; and there, as the Palace clock struck
    twelve&mdash;complying precisely with Don Mendo's
    condition&mdash;Doña Paz bowed her head to the
    ground; and then, so bowing, she made the
    turn which among the common people of
    Mexico is called a machincuepa! So did Doña
    Paz win for herself Don Mendo's millions of
    dollars: and so did come into the soul of her the
    bitterness of shame that Don Mendo meant
    should come into it&mdash;in reward for the bitterness
    with which her cruelties had filled his
    dying years!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
<p>What became of this young lady&mdash;who so
    sacrificed propriety in order to gain riches&mdash;I
    never have heard mentioned: but it is certain
    that the street in which she lived immediately
    got the name of the Street of the Machincuepa&mdash;and
    the exact truth of every detail of this
    curious story is attested by the fact that that
    is its name now.</p>
<p>Perhaps the meaning of this word machincuepa,
    Señor&mdash;being, as Don Mendo said in
    his will, a word in use among the common
    people of Mexico&mdash;is unknown to you. The
    meaning of it, in good Spanish, is salto mortal&mdash;only
    it means more. And it was precisely
    that sort of an excessive somersault&mdash;there
    in the middle of the crowded Plaza Mayor at
    noonday&mdash;that the most proud and the most
    dignified Doña Paz turned!</p>

<h2><a name="LEGEND_OF_THE_CALLE_DEL_PUENTE" id="LEGEND_OF_THE_CALLE_DEL_PUENTE">LEGEND OF THE CALLE DEL PUENTE
    DEL CUERVO</a></h2>
<p>As you know, Señor, in the street that
    is called the Street of the Bridge of the
    Raven, there nowadays is no bridge at all;
    also, the house is gone in which this Don
    Rodrigo de Ballesteros lived with his raven in
    the days when he was alive. As to the raven,
    however, matters are less certain. My grand-father
    long ago told me that more than once,
    on nights of storm, he had heard that evil bird
    uttering his wicked caws at midnight between
    the thunderclaps; and a most respectable cargador
    of my acquaintance has given me his word
    for it that he has heard those cawings too. Yet
    if they still go on it must be the raven's spectre
    that gives voice to them; because, Señor, while
    ravens are very long-lived birds, it is improbable
    that they live&mdash;and that much time has passed
    since these matters happened&mdash;through more
    than the whole of three hundred years.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
<p>This Don Rodrigo in his youth, Señor, was
    a Captain of Arcabuceros in the Royal Army;
    and, it seems, he fought so well with his crossbowmen
    at the battle of San Quintin (what
    they were fighting about I do not know) that
    the King of Spain rewarded him&mdash;when the
    fighting was all over and there was no more
    need for his services&mdash;by making him a royal
    commissioner here in Mexico: that he might
    get rich comfortably in his declining years.
    It was the Encomienda of Atzcapotzalco that
    the King gave to him; and in those days
    Atzcapotzalco was a very rich place, quite
    away from the City westward, and yielded a
    great revenue for Don Rodrigo to have the
    fingering of. Nowadays, as you know, Señor,
    it is almost a part of the City, because you get
    to it in the electric cars so quickly; and it has
    lost its good fortune and is but a dreary little
    threadbare town.</p>
<p>It was with the moneys which stuck to his
    fingers from his collectorship&mdash;just as the
    King meant that they should stick, in reward
    for his good fighting&mdash;that Don Rodrigo built
    for himself his fine house in the street that is
    now called, because of the bridge that once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> was a part of it, and because of the raven's
    doings, the Puente del Cuervo. If that street
    had another name, earlier, Señor, I do not
    know what it was.</p>
<p>This Don Rodrigo, as was generally known,
    was a very wicked person; and therefore he
    lived in his fine house, along with his raven, in
    great magnificence&mdash;eating always from dishes
    of solid silver, and being served by pages wearing
    clothes embroidered with gold. But, for
    all his riches, he himself was clad as though he
    were a beggar&mdash;and a very dirty beggar at that.
    Over his jerkin and breeches he wore a long
    capellar that wrapped him from his neck to
    his heels loosely; and this capellar had been
    worn by him through so many years that it
    was shabby beyond all respectability, and
    stained with stains of all colors, and everywhere
    greasy and soiled. Yet on the front of it,
    upon his breast, he wore the Cross of Santiago
    that the King had given him; and wearing
    that cross, as you know, Señor, made him as
    much of a caballero as the very best. In various
    other ways the evil that was in him showed
    itself. He never went to mass, and he made
    fun openly of all holy things. The suspicion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> was entertained by many people that he had
    intimacies with heretics. Such conduct gives
    a man a very bad name now; but it gave a man
    a worse name then&mdash;and so he was known
    generally as the Excommunicate, which was
    the very worst name that anybody could have.</p>
<p>As to the raven, Señor, Don Rodrigo himself
    named it El Diablo; and that it truly was
    the devil&mdash;or, at least, that it was a devil&mdash;no
    one ever doubted at all. The conduct of that
    reprobate bird was most offensive. It would
    soil the rich furnishings of the house; it would
    tear with its beak the embroidered coverings
    of the chairs and the silken tapestries; it
    would throw down and shatter valuable pieces
    of glass and porcelain; there was no end
    to its misdeeds. But when Don Rodrigo
    stormed at his servants about these wreckings&mdash;and
    he was a most violent man, Señor, and
    used tempestuous language&mdash;the servants had
    only to tell him that the raven was the guilty
    one to pacify him instantly. &quot;If it is the
    work of the Devil,&quot; he would say without
    anger, &quot;it is well done!&quot;&mdash;and so the matter
    would pass.</p>
<p>Suddenly, on a day, both Don Rodrigo and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> the raven disappeared. Their going, in that
    strange and sudden way, made a great commotion;
    but there was a greater commotion
    when the Alcalde&mdash;being called to look into
    the matter&mdash;entered the house to search it and
    found a very horrible thing. In the room that
    had been Don Rodrigo's bedroom, lying dishonored
    upon the floor, broken and blood-spattered,
    was the most holy image; and all
    about it were lying raven feathers, and they
    also were spattered with blood. Therefore it
    was known that the raven-devil and Don
    Rodrigo had beaten the holy image and had
    drawn blood from it; and that the great devil,
    the master of both of them, in penalty for their
    dreadful act of sacrilege, had snatched them
    suddenly home to him to burn forever in hell.
    That was the very proper end of them. Never
    were they seen again either on sea or land.</p>
<p>Naturally, Señor, respectable people declined
    to live in a house where there had been
    such shocking doings. Even the people living
    in the adjoining houses, feeling the disgrace
    that was on the neighborhood, moved away
    from them. And so, slowly, as the years went
    on, all of those houses crumbled to pieces and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> fell into ruins which were carted away&mdash;and
    that is why they no longer are there. But it
    is generally known, Señor, that until Don
    Rodrigo's house did in that way go out of
    existence, Don Rodrigo continued to inhabit it;
    and that the raven continued to bear him
    company.</p>
<p>Just a year from the time that the devil had
    snatched away to hell the two of them&mdash;and
    it was at midnight, and a storm was upon the
    City&mdash;the neighbors heard between the thunder-claps
    the clock on the Palace striking its twelve
    strokes; and then, between the next thunder-claps,
    they heard the raven caw twelve times.
    Then it became known that the raven nightly
    took up its post on the parapet of the bridge
    that was in that street; and that, when his
    cawing for midnight was ended, he habitually
    flew up into the balcony of Don Rodrigo's
    house; and that on the balcony he found Don
    Rodrigo&mdash;a yellow skeleton, and over the
    bones of it the dirty old capellar&mdash;ready and
    waiting for him. Don Rodrigo's skeleton
    would be sitting quite at its ease on the
    balcony; on the railing of the balcony would
    be perched the raven; and with his dry-bone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> fingers&mdash;making a little clicking sound, like
    that of castanets&mdash;Don Rodrigo would stroke
    gently the back of that intensely wicked bird.
    All this would show for a moment while the
    lightning was flashing; then darkness would
    come, and a crash of thunder; and after the
    thunder, in the black silence, the little clicking
    sound of Don Rodrigo's dry-bone fingers stroking
    the raven's back gently again would be
    heard.</p>
<p>And so it all went on, Señor, my grandfather
    told me, until the house tumbled down with age,
    and these disagreeable horrors no longer were
    possible; and it is most reasonably evident&mdash;since
    the street got its name because of them&mdash;that
    they really must have happened, and that
    they must have continued for a very long
    time.</p>
<p>As I have mentioned, Señor, my friend the
    cargador&mdash;who is a most respectable and truthful
    person&mdash;declares that sometimes on stormy
    nights he himself has heard the raven's cawings
    when the Palace clock has finished its twelve
    strokes; and from that it would appear that the
    raven is to be met with in the Puente del
    Cuervo even now.</p>

<p>As is generally known,
    Señor, many bad things
    are met with by night in the streets of
    the City; but this Wailing Woman, La Llorona,
    is the very worst of them all. She is worse by
    far than the vaca de lumbre&mdash;that at midnight
    comes forth from the potrero of San Pablo and
    goes galloping through the streets like a blazing
    whirlwind, breathing forth from her nostrils
    smoke and sparks and flames: because the
    Fiery Cow, Señor, while a dangerous animal to
    look at, really does no harm whatever&mdash;and
    La Llorona is as harmful as she can be!</p>
<p>Seeing her walking quietly along the quiet
    street&mdash;at the times when she is not running,
    and shrieking for her lost children&mdash;she seems
    a respectable person, only odd looking because
    of her white petticoat and the white reboso
    with which her head is covered, and anybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> might speak to her. But whoever does speak
    to her, in that very same moment dies!</p>
<p>The beginning of her was so long ago that no
    one knows when was the beginning of her; nor
    does any one know anything about her at all.
    But it is known certainly that at the beginning
    of her, when she was a living woman, she committed
    bad sins. As soon as ever a child was
    born to her she would throw it into one of the
    canals which surround the City, and so would
    drown it; and she had a great many children,
    and this practice in regard to them she continued
    for a long time. At last her conscience
    began to prick her about what she did with her
    children; but whether it was that the priest
    spoke to her, or that some of the saints cautioned
    her in the matter, no one knows. But
    it is certain that because of her sinnings she
    began to go through the streets in the darkness
    weeping and wailing. And presently it was
    said that from night till morning there was a
    wailing woman in the streets; and to see her,
    being in terror of her, many people went forth
    at midnight; but none did see her, because she
    could be seen only when the street was deserted
    and she was alone.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>
<p>Sometimes she would come to a sleeping
    watchman, and would waken him by asking:
    &quot;What time is it?&quot; And he would see a
    woman clad in white standing beside him with
    her reboso drawn over her face. And he would
    answer: &quot;It is twelve hours of the night.&quot;
    And she would say: &quot;At twelve hours of this
    day I must be in Guadalajara!&quot;&mdash;or it might
    be in San Luis Potosí, or in some other far-distant
    city&mdash;and, so speaking, she would
    shriek bitterly: &quot;Where shall I find my
    children?&quot;&mdash;and would vanish instantly and
    utterly away. And the watchman would feel
    as though all his senses had gone from him,
    and would become as a dead man. This happened
    many times to many watchmen, who
    made report of it to their officers; but their
    officers would not believe what they told. But
    it happened, on a night, that an officer of the
    watch was passing by the lonely street beside
    the church of Santa Anita. And there he
    met with a woman wearing a white reboso and
    a white petticoat; and to her he began to make
    love. He urged her, saying: &quot;Throw off your
    reboso that I may see your pretty face!&quot;
    And suddenly she uncovered her face&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> what he beheld was a bare grinning skull set
    fast to the bare bones of a skeleton! And
    while he looked at her, being in horror, there
    came from her fleshless jaws an icy breath; and
    the iciness of it froze the very heart's blood
    in him, and he fell to the earth heavily in a
    deathly swoon. When his senses came back
    to him he was greatly troubled. In fear he
    returned to the Diputacion, and there told
    what had befallen him. And in a little while
    his life forsook him and he died.</p>
<p>What is most wonderful about this Wailing
    Woman, Señor, is that she is seen in the same
    moment by different people in places widely
    apart: one seeing her hurrying across the
    atrium of the Cathedral; another beside the
    Arcos de San Cosme; and yet another near the
    Salto del Agua, over by the prison of Belen.
    More than that, in one single night she will be
    seen in Monterey and in Oaxaca and in Acapulco&mdash;the
    whole width and length of the land apart&mdash;and
    whoever speaks with her in those far
    cities, as here in Mexico, immediately dies in
    fright. Also, she is seen at times in the country.
    Once some travellers coming along a lonely
    road met with her, and asked: &quot;Where go you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> on this lonely road?&quot; And for answer she cried:
    &quot;Where shall I find my children?&quot; and, shrieking,
    disappeared. And one of the travellers
    went mad. Being come here to the City they
    told what they had seen; and were told that
    this same Wailing Woman had maddened or
    killed many people here also.</p>
<p>Because the Wailing Woman is so generally
    known, Señor, and so greatly feared, few
    people now stop her when they meet with her
    to speak with her&mdash;therefore few now die of
    her, and that is fortunate. But her loud keen
    wailings, and the sound of her running feet,
    are heard often; and especially in nights of
    storm. I myself, Señor, have heard the running
    of her feet and her wailings; but I never
    have seen her. God forbid that I ever shall!</p>

<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 2px">LEGEND OF DON JUAN MANUEL</span></h3>
<p>Don Juan Manuel was a real person: who lived
    stately in a great house, still standing, in the street
    that in his time was called the Calle Nueva, and that
    since his time has borne his name; who certainly did
    murder one man&mdash;in that house, not in the street&mdash;at
    about, probably, eleven o'clock at night; and who
    certainly was found hanging dead on the gallows in
    front of the Capilla de la Espiración, of an October
    morning in the year 1641, without any explanation
    ever being forthcoming of how he got there. What
    survive of the tangled curious facts on which the
    fancies of this legend rest have been collected by
    Señor Obregón, and here are summarized.</p>
<p>Don Juan Manuel de Solórzano, a native of Burgos,
    a man of rank and wealth, in the year 1623 came in
    the train of the Viceroy the Marqués de Guadalcázar to
    Mexico; where for a long while he seems to have led a
    life prosperous and respectable. In the year 1636 he
    increased his fortune by making an excellent marriage&mdash;with
    Doña Mariana de Laguna, the daughter of a
    rich mine-owner of Zacatecas. His troubles had their
    beginning in an intimate friendship that he formed with
    the Viceroy (1635-1640) the Marqués de Cadereita; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> friendship of so practical a sort on the side of the
    Viceroy as to cause remonstrance to be made in Spain
    against his excessive bestowal of official favors on his
    favorite. Moreover, &quot;the evil speaking of the curious&quot;
    was excited by the fact that Don Juan and his wife
    spent a great part of their time at the Palace in the
    Viceroy's company.</p>
<p>Matters were brought to a crisis by Don Juan's
    appointment as Administrator of the Royal Hacienda;
    an office that gave him control of the great revenues
    derived from the fleets which plied annually between
    Mexico and Spain. The conduct of this very lucrative
    administration previously had been with the Audiencia;
    and by the members of that body vigorous protest was
    made against the Viceroy's action in enriching his
    favorite at their cost. &quot;Odious gossip&quot; was aroused;
    threats were made of a popular uprising; an appeal&mdash;duly
    freighted with bribes to assure its arrival at the
    throne&mdash;was made to the King. &quot;But the springs put
    in force by the Viceroy must have been very powerful&mdash;more
    powerful than the money sent by the Audiencia&mdash;since
    Philip IV. confirmed Don Juan in the enjoyment
    of his concession.&quot;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 482px;"> <img src="images/illus-181.jpg" width="482" height="800" alt="" /> <span class="caption">HOUSE OF DON JUAN MANUEL</span> </div>
<p>While the case thus rested, an incidental scandal
    was introduced into it. By the fleet from Spain came
    one Doña Ana Porcel de Velasco: a lady of good birth,
    very beautiful, the widow of a naval officer, reduced
    by her widowhood and by other misfortunes to poverty.
    In her happier days she had been a beauty at Court,
    and there the Marqués de Cadereita had known her
    and had made suit to her, wherefore she had come to
    Mexico to seek his Viceregal protection. Housing her
    in the Palace being out of the question, the Viceroy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> begged that Don Juan would take her into his own
    home: and that disposition of her, accordingly, was
    made&mdash;with the result that more &quot;odious gossip&quot; was
    aroused. What became of the beautiful Doña Ana is
    unrecorded. Her episodic existence in the story seems
    to be due to the fact that because of her the popular
    ill-will against Don Juan and against the Viceroy was
    increased.</p>
<p>A far-reaching ripple from the wave of the Portuguese
    and Catalonian revolt of the year 1640, influencing
    affairs in Mexico, gave opportunity for this ill-will to
    crystallize into action of so effective a sort that the
    Viceroy was recalled, and his favorite&mdash;no longer under
    protection&mdash;was cast into prison. Don Juan's commitment&mdash;the
    specific charge against him is not recorded&mdash;was
    signed by one Don Francisco Vélez de
    Pereira: who, as Señor Obregón puts it, &quot;was not only
    a Judge of the criminal court but a criminal Judge&quot;
    (<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">no era solamente un Alcalde del crímen sino un Alcalde
    criminal</i>) because he made dishonest proposals to
    Doña Mariana as the price of her husband's liberation.
    It would seem that Doña Mariana accepted the offered
    terms; and in so grateful a spirit that she was
    content to wait upon the Alcalde's pleasure for their
    complete ratification by Don Juan's deliverance.
    Pending such liquidation of the contract, news was
    carried to Don Juan in prison of the irregular negotiations
    in progress to procure his freedom: whereupon
    he procured it for himself, one night, by breaking jail.
    Going straight to his own home, he found there the
    Alcalde&mdash;and incontinently killed him.</p>
<p>That one killing that Don Juan Manuel certainly
    did commit&mdash;out of which, probably, has come the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> legend of his many murders&mdash;created, because of the
    high estate of all concerned in it, a deplorable scandal:
    that the Audiencia&mdash;while resolved to bring Don Juan
    to justice&mdash;sought to allay by hushing up, so far as was
    possible, the whole affair. The Duque de Escalona, the
    new Viceroy (1640-1642), was at one with the Audiencia
    in its hushing-up policy; but was determined&mdash;for
    reasons of his own which are unrecorded&mdash;that Don
    Juan should not be executed. So, for a considerable
    period of time, during which Don Juan remained in
    prison, the matter rested. The event seems to imply
    that the Audiencia accomplished its stern purpose, as
    opposed to the lenient purpose of the Viceroy, by means
    as informal as they were effective. Certainly, on a
    morning in October, 1641, precisely as described in the
    legend, Don Juan Manuel was found hanging dead on
    the gallows in front of the Capilla de la Espiración.
    Señor Obregón concludes the historical portion of his
    narrative in these words: &quot;The Oidores, whose orders
    it is reasonable to suppose brought about that dark
    deed, attributed it to the angels&mdash;but there history
    ends and legend begins.&quot;</p>

<p>Somewhere in the course of my readings&mdash;I cannot
    remember where&mdash;I have come upon the seriously
    made suggestion that Don Juan Manuel practically
    was a bravo: that the favors which he received from
    the Viceroy were his payment for putting politically
    obnoxious persons out of the way. This specious explanation
    does account for his traditional many murders,
    but is not in accord with probability. Aside
    from the fact that bravos rarely are men of rank and
    wealth, a series of murders traceable to political motives
    during the Viceregal term of the Marqués de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> Cadereita&mdash;whose many enemies keenly were alive
    to his misdoings&mdash;almost certainly would be found,
    but is not found, recorded in the chronicles of his time.
    Such omission effectively puts this picturesque explanation
    of Don Juan's doings out of court.</p>

<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 2px">LEGEND OF THE ALTAR DEL PERDON</span></h3>
<p>Simon Peyrens, a Flemish painter, came to Mexico
    in the suite of the third Viceroy (1566-1568) Don
    Gastón de Peralta, Marqués de Falces. If he painted&mdash;and,
    presumably, he did paint&mdash;a Virgin of Mercy
    for the Altar del Perdon, his picture has disappeared:
    doubtless having been removed from the altar when the
    present Cathedral (begun, 1573; dedicated, though then
    incomplete, 1656) replaced the primitive structure
    erected a few years after the Conquest. The Virgin
    of the Candelaria on the existing Altar del Perdon was
    painted by Baltasar de Echave, the Elder; a Spanish
    artist of eminence who came to Mexico about the end
    of the sixteenth century. Peyrens certainly had the
    opportunity to do his work under conditions akin to,
    but decidedly more unpleasant than, those set forth
    in the legend: as Señor Obregón has made clear by producing
    facts which exhibit the afflictions of that unfortunate
    artist; and which also, incidentally, account
    for the appearance in Mexico of a miracle-story that in
    varying forms is found in the saintly chronicles of
    many lands.</p>
<p>Señor Obregón's source is an original document of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> the time of Fray Alonso de Montúfar; a Dominican
    brother who was the second Archbishop of Mexico
    (1554-1572), and who also held the office of Inquisitor&mdash;in
    accordance with the custom that obtained until
    the formal establishment (1571) of the Inquisition in
    Mexico. It was before him, therefore, as represented
    by his Provisor, that the case of Peyrens was brought.</p>
<p>As stated in this document, Peyrens had declared in
    familiar talk with friends that simple incontinence was
    not a sin; and he farther had declared that he liked to
    paint portraits, and that he did not like to, and would
    not, paint saints nor pictures of a devotional sort.
    His friends admonished him that his views in regard to
    incontinence made him liable to arraignment before the
    ecclesiastical authorities; whereupon&mdash;seemingly seeking,
    as a measure of prudence, to forestall by his own
    confession any charge that might be brought against
    him&mdash;he &quot;denounced himself,&quot; on September 10,
    1568, to Fray Bartolomé de Ledesma, Gobernador de la
    Mitra. As the result of his confession&mdash;instead of
    being granted the absolution that he obviously expected
    to receive&mdash;he was arrested and cast into prison.</p>
<p>Four days later, September 14th, he was examined
    formally. To the questions propounded to him, he
    replied, in substance: That he had been born in Antwerp,
    the son of Fero Peyrens and of Constanza Lira
    his wife; that he was not of Jewish descent; that none
    of his family had been dealt with by the Inquisition;
    that in his early manhood he had gone to Lisbon and
    later to Toledo, where the Court then was seated, to
    practice his profession as a painter; that he had come
    to New Spain, in the suite of the Viceroy, in the hope
    of bettering his fortunes. In regard to the charges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> against him, he explained: That what he had said about
    the sinlessness of simple incontinence had been spoken
    lightly in friendly talk, and, moreover, very well might
    have been misunderstood because of his imperfect
    knowledge of the Spanish tongue; and that what he
    had said about liking to paint portraits and not being
    willing to paint saints had been said only because
    portrait-painting was the better paid. His trial followed:
    at which nothing more was produced against him&mdash;although
    a number of witnesses, including &quot;many
    painters,&quot; were interrogated&mdash;than the facts brought
    out in his own examination.</p>
<p>In order to force from Peyrens himself a fuller and
    more incriminating confession, the Provisor, Don
    Estéban de Portillo, ordered that he should be &quot;submitted
    to the test of torture.&quot; This test was applied on
    December 1st&mdash;when Peyrens &quot;supported three turns
    of the rack and swallowed three jars of water dripped
    into his mouth by a linen rag,&quot; without modifying or
    enlarging his previous declarations. By the rules of
    the game&mdash;he having, in the jargon of the Inquisition,
    &quot;conquered his torment&quot;&mdash;the proceedings against
    him then should have ended. Mr. Lea, commenting
    on his case (&quot;The Inquisition in the Spanish Dependencies,&quot;
    p. 198), writes: &quot;This ought to have
    earned his dismissal, but on December 4th he was
    condemned to pay the costs of his trial and to give
    security that he would not leave the City until he should
    have painted a picture of Our Lady of Merced, as an
    altar-piece for the church. He complied, and it was
    duly hung in the Cathedral.&quot;</p>
<p>I have not found&mdash;seemingly, Mr. Lea did find&mdash;a
    record of the actual painting of the picture. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> sentence passed on Peyrens is given in full by Señor
    Obregón&mdash;in archaic Spanish, whereof much of the
    queer flavor evaporates in translation&mdash;and is as
    follows:</p>

<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 2px">LEGEND OF THE CALLE DE LA CRUZ VERDE</span></h3>
<p>Señor Arellano has documented the legend of the
    Green Cross by adding to his sympathetic version of it
    the following note: &quot;Some years ago I saw in either the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> church of San Miguel or the church of San Pablo, set
    aside in a corner, a bronze tablet that once had rested
    upon a tomb. On it was the inscription, 'Doña María
    de Aldarafuente Lara y Segura de Manrique. Agosto
    11 de 1573 años. R.I.P.'; and beneath the inscription
    was a large Latin cross. Probably the tablet was
    melted up. When I went to look for it, later, it was
    not to be found.&quot;</p>
<p>This record testifies to the truth of the pretty legend
    to the extent that it proves that the hero and the
    heroine of it were real people, and that their wedding
    really took place; and it also testifies to the melancholy
    fact&mdash;since Don Alvaro came to Mexico in the train
    of the Viceroy Don Gastón de Peralta, whose entry into
    the Capital was made on September 17, 1566&mdash;that
    their wedded life lasted less than seven years. The
    once stately but now shabby house whereon the cross
    is carved is in what anciently was a dignified quarter
    of the City; and the niche for a saint, vacant now,
    above the cross is one of the characteristics of the old
    houses in which people of condition lived. The cross
    is unique. No other house in the City is ornamented
    in this way.</p>

<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 2px">LEGEND OF THE MUJER HERRADA</span></h3>
<p>Doubtless this legend has for its foundation an
    ancient real scandal: that&mdash;being too notorious to be
    hushed up&mdash;of set purpose was given to the public in a
    highly edifying way. Certainly, the story seems to
    have been put in shape by the clerics&mdash;the class most
    interested in checking such open abuses&mdash;with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> view of driving home a deterrent moral by exhibiting
    so exemplary a punishment of sin.</p>
<p>Substantially as in the popular version that I have
    used in my text, Don Francisco Sedano (circa 1760)
    tells the story in his delightful &quot;Noticias de México&quot;&mdash;a
    gossiping chronicle that, on the dual ground of
    kindly credulity and genial inaccuracy, cannot be
    commended in too warm terms.</p>
<p>&quot;In the years 1670-1680, as I have verified,&quot;
    Sedano writes, &quot;there happened in this City of Mexico
    a formidable and fearful matter&quot;; and without farther
    prelude he tells the story practically as I have told it,
    but in much plainer language, until he reaches the
    climax: when the priest and the blacksmith try to
    awaken the woman that she may enjoy the joke with
    them. Thence he continues: &quot;When a second call failed
    to arouse her they looked at her more closely, and
    found that she was dead; and then, examining her still
    more closely, they found nailed fast to her hands and
    to her feet the four iron shoes. Then they knew that
    divine justice thus had afflicted her, and that the two
    blacks were demons. Being overcome with horror,
    and not knowing what course to follow in a situation
    so terrible, they agreed to go together for counsel to
    Dr. Don Francisco Ortiz, cura of the parish church of
    Santa Catarina; and him they brought back with them.
    On their return, they found already in the house
    Father José Vidal, of the Company of Jesus, and with
    him a Carmelite monk who also had been summoned.
    [By whom summoned is not told.] All of them together
    examining the woman, they saw that she had a
    bit in her mouth [the iron shoes on her hands and feet
    are not mentioned] and that on her body were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> welts left by the blows which the demons had given her
    when they took her to be shod in the form of a mule.
    The three aforesaid [the Cura, Father Vidal, and the
    Carmelite] then agreed that the woman should be
    buried in a pit, that they then dug, within the house;
    and that upon all concerned in the matter should be
    enjoined secrecy. The terrified priest, trembling with
    fear, declared that he would change his life&mdash;and so
    left the house, and never appeared again.&quot;</p>
<p>Sedano documents the story with facts concerning
    the reputable clerics concerned in it, writing: &quot;Dr.
    Ortiz, cura de Santa Catarina, being internally moved
    [by what he had seen] to enter into religion, entered
    the Company of Jesus; wherein he continued, greatly
    esteemed and respected, until his death at the age of
    eighty-four years. He referred always to this case
    with amazement. A memoir of Father José Vidal,
    celebrated for his virtues and for his preaching, was
    written by Father Juan Antonio de Oviedo, of the
    Company of Jesus, and was printed in the College of
    San Yldefonso in the year 1752. In that memoir,
    chapter viii, p. 41, this case is mentioned; a record of
    it having been found among the papers of Father
    Vidal.&quot; Sedano adds that he himself heard the case
    referred to in a Lenten sermon preached by a Jesuit
    Father in the church of the Profesa in the year 1760.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;"> <img src="images/illus-195.jpg" width="454" height="800" alt="" /> <span class="caption">NO. 7 PUERTA FALSA DE SANTO DOMINGO</span> </div>
<p>Sedano farther writes: &quot;In the Calle de las Rejas de
    la Balvanera is a casa de vecindad [tenement house]
    that formerly was called the Casa del Pujabante: because
    a pujabante and tenazos [farrier's knife and
    pincers] were carved on the stone lintel of the doorway.
    This carving I have seen many times. It was said to
    mark the house in which the blacksmith lived, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> memory of the shoeing of the woman there. The house
    [the site is that of the present No. 5] has been repaired
    and the carving has been obliterated. In the street
    of the Puerta Falsa de Santo Domingo, along the
    middle of which anciently ran a ditch, facing the
    Puerta Falsa, was an old tumble-down house [the site
    is that of the present No. 7] wherein lived, as I was told
    by an antiquarian friend, the priest and the woman.
    This is probable: because Father Vidal tells that the
    house was near the parish church of Santa Catarina;
    and for that reason Dr. Ortiz, the cura of that church,
    would be likely to make notes of an occurrence in his
    own parish.&quot;</p>

<h2><span style="letter-spacing: 2px"><a name="NOTE_VI" id="NOTE_VI">NOTE VI</a></span></h2>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 2px">LEGEND OF THE ACCURSED BELL</span></h3>
<p>This legend affords an interesting example of folk-growth.
    As told by Señor Obregón, the story simply
    is of a church bell &quot;in a little town in Spain&quot; that,
    being possessed by a devil, rang in an unseemly fashion
    without human aid; and for that sin was condemned
    to have its tongue torn out and to be banished to
    Mexico. As told by Señor Arellano, the story begins
    with armor that was devil-possessed because worn by
    the devil-possessed Gil de Marcadante. This armor
    is recast into a cross wherein the devils are held prisoners
    and harmless; the cross is recast into a bell of which
    the loosed devils have possession&mdash;and from that point
    the story goes on as before. As told in verse by
    Señor Juan de Dios Peza, the armor is devil-forged to
    start with; and is charged still more strongly with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> devilishness by being worn in succession by an Infidel
    and by a wicked feudal lord before it comes to Gil de
    Marcadante&mdash;from whose possession of it the story
    continues as before.</p>
<p>A fourth, wholly Spanish, version of this legend is
    found in Becquer's <cite>La Cruz del Diablo</cite>. In this version
    the armor belongs in the beginning to one Señor del
    Segre, whose cruelties lead to a revolt of his vassals
    that ends in his death and in the burning of his castle&mdash;amid
    the ruins of which the armor remains hanging on
    a fire-blackened pillar. In time, bandits make their
    lair in the ruined castle. While a hot dispute over
    their leadership is in progress among them the armor
    detaches itself from the pillar and stalks into the midst
    of the wrangling company. From behind the closed
    visor a voice declares that their leader is found. Under
    that leadership the bandits commit all manner of
    atrocities. Again the country folk rally to fight
    for their lives. Many of the bandits are killed, but the
    leader is scatheless. Swords and lances pass through
    the armor without injuring him. In the blaze of burning
    dwellings the armor becomes white-hot, but he is
    unharmed. A wise hermit counsels exorcism. With
    this spiritual weapon the devil-leader is overcome and
    captured; and within the armor they find&mdash;nothing at
    all! In true folk-story fashion the narrative rambles
    on with details of the escape and recapture of the
    devil-armor &quot;a hundred times.&quot; In the end, following
    again the wise hermit's counsel, the armor is cast into
    a furnace; and then, being melted, is refounded&mdash;to the
    accompaniment of diabolical shrieks and groans of
    agony&mdash;into a cross. A curious and distinctive feature
    of this version is that the devils imprisoned in the cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> retain their power for evil. Prayers made before that
    cross bring down curses; criminals resort to it; in its
    neighborhood is peril of death by violence to honest
    men. So leaving the matter, Becquer's story ends.
    The scene of these marvels is the town of Bellver, on
    the river Segre, close under the southern slope of the
    Pyrenees.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p>Señor Obregón gives what is known of the bell's
    history in Mexico. It was of &quot;medium size&quot;; the
    hanger in the shape of an imperial crown supported
    by two lions; on one side, in relief, the two-headed eagle
    holding in its talons the arms of Austria; on the other
    side a Calvario&mdash;Christ, St. John, the Virgin; near the
    lip, the words &quot;Salve Regina,&quot; and the legend: &quot;Maese
    Rodrigo me fecit 1530.&quot; From the unknown time of
    its arrival in Mexico until the last quarter of the
    eighteenth century it reposed idly in one of the corridors
    of the Palace. There it was found by the Viceroy
    (1789-1794) the Conde de Revillagigedo; and by that
    very energetic personage, to whom idleness of any sort
    was abhorrent, promptly was set to work. In accordance
    with his orders, it was hung in a bell-gable, over
    the central doorway of the Palace, directly above the
    clock; and in that position it remained, very honestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> doing its duty as a clock-bell, for more than seventy
    years. During the period of the French intervention,
    in December, 1867, a new bell was installed in place of
    it and orders were given that it should be melted down&mdash;possibly,
    though Señor Obregón gives no information
    on this point, to be recast into cannon, along with
    the many church bells that went that way in Mexico
    at about that time. Whatever may have been planned
    in regard to its transmutation did not come off&mdash;because
    the liquid metal became refractory and could not be
    recast. As this curious statement of fact has an
    exceptional interest in the case of a bell with so bad a
    record, I repeat it in Señor Obregón's own words:
    &quot;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Entonces se mandó fundirla; mas al verificarlo se descompuso
    el metal!</i>&quot;</p>

<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 2px">LEGEND OF THE CALLEJÓN DEL PADRE LECUONA</span></h3>
<p>By a natural confusion of the name of the street in
    which the dead man was confessed with the name of
    the priest who heard his confession, this legend frequently
    is told nowadays as relating not to Padre
    Lanza but to Padre Lecuona. An old man whom
    I met in the Callejón del Padre Lecuona, when I was
    making search for the scene of the confession, told me
    the story in that way&mdash;and pointed out the house to
    me in all sincerity. Following that telling, I so mixed
    the matter myself in my first publication of the legend.
    Who Padre Lecuona was, or why the street was named
    after him, I have not discovered. Probably still another
    legend lurks there. Señor Riva Palacio tells the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> story as of an unnamed friar &quot;whom God now holds
    in his glory,&quot; and assigns it to the year 1731. The
    motive of the story is found in Spain long before the
    oldest date assigned to it in Mexico. The wicked hero
    of Calderon's play, <cite>La devocion de la Cruz</cite>, is permitted
    to purge his sinful soul by confession after
    death. The Padre Lanza whose name has been tacked
    fast to the story&mdash;probably because his well-known
    charitable ministrations to the poor made him a likely
    person to yield to the old woman's importunities&mdash;was
    a real man who lived in the City of Mexico, greatly
    loved and respected, in the early years of the nineteenth
    century. Señor Roa Bárcena fixes the decade 1820-1830
    as the date of his strange adventure with a dead
    body in which was a living soul.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;"> <img src="images/illus-201.jpg" width="800" height="444" alt="" /> <span class="caption">WHERE THE DEAD MAN WAS CONFESSED</span> </div>
<p>Aside from minor variants, two distinct versions of
    this legend are current. That which I have given in
    my text is the more popular. The other, less widely
    known, has for its scene an old house in the Calle de
    Olmedo&mdash;nearly a mile away from the Callejón del
    Padre Lecuona, and in a far more ancient quarter of the
    City. Concisely stated, the Calle de Olmedo version
    is to this effect:</p>
<p>Brother Mendo, a worthy and kind-hearted friar,
    is met of a dark night in the street by a man who begs
    him to come and hear a dying person confess. The
    friar wears the habit of his Order, and from his girdle
    hangs his rosary. He is led to a house near by; and
    finds within the house a very beautiful woman, richly
    clad in silks, whose arms are bound. That she is not
    in a dying state is obvious, and the friar asks for an
    explanation. For answer, the man tells him roughly:
    &quot;This woman is about to die by violence. I must give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> her death. As you please, wash clean her sinful soul&mdash;or
    leave it foul!&quot; At that, he yields, and her confession
    begins. It is so prolonged that the man, losing
    patience, ends it abruptly by thrusting forth the friar
    from the house. Through the closed door he hears
    shrieks and tries to re-enter; but the door remains
    closed firmly, and his knocking is unheeded. He finds
    that his rosary no longer is at his girdle. In order to
    recover it, and to allay his fears for the woman's safety,
    he calls a watchman to aid him by demanding in the
    name of the law that the door shall be opened. No
    response is made from within to their violent knocking;
    and an old woman, aroused by it, comes out from a nearby
    dwelling and tells them that knocking there is useless&mdash;that
    through all her long lifetime she has lived
    beside that house, and that never through all her long
    lifetime has that house been inhabited. The watchman&mdash;holding
    his lantern close to the door, and so
    perceiving that what she tells is verified by the caked
    dust that fills its crevices and that clogs its key-hole&mdash;is
    for abandoning their attempt to enter. The friar
    insists that they must enter: that his rosary is within
    the house; that he is determined to recover it; that the
    door must be forced. Yielding to him, the watchman
    forces the door and together they enter: to find a
    yellowed skeleton upon the floor; scattered around it
    scraps of mouldering silk; in the eye-sockets of the
    skull cobwebs&mdash;and lying across that yellowed skeleton
    is the friar's rosary! Brother Mendo covers his face
    with his hands, totters for a moment, and then falls
    dying as he exclaims in horror: &quot;Holy God! I have
    confessed a soul from the other life!&quot; And the
    crowd of neighbors, by that time assembled, cries out:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> &quot;Brother Mendo is dead because he has confessed the
    dead!&quot;</p>

<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 2px">LEGEND OF THE LIVING SPECTRE</span></h3>
<p>The theme of this legend&mdash;the transportation by
    supernatural means of a living person from one part of
    the world to another&mdash;is among the most widely distributed
    of folk-story motives. In <cite>The Arabian
    Nights</cite>&mdash;to name an easily accessible work of reference&mdash;it
    is found repeatedly in varying forms. In Irving's <cite>Alhambra</cite> a version of it is given&mdash;&quot;Governor Manco
    and the Old Soldier&quot;&mdash;that has a suggestive resemblance
    to the version of my text. Distinction is given
    to the Mexican story, however, by its presentment by
    serious historians in association with, and as an incident
    of, an otherwise well-authenticated historical
    tragedy.</p>
<p>That Don Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas, Governor of the
    Filipinas, did have his head badly split open, and died
    of it, in the Molucca Islands, on the 25th of October in
    the year 1593, and that on that same day announcement
    of his so-painful ending was made in the City of Mexico,
    are statements of natural and of supernatural fact
    which equally rest upon authority the most respectable:
    as appears from Señor Obregón's documentation of the
    legend, that I here present in a condensed form.</p>
<p>Guarded testimony in support of the essential
    marvel of the story is found in a grave historical work
    of the period, <cite>Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas</cite>, written by
    the learned Dr. Antonio de Morga, a Judge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> Criminal Court of the Royal Audiencia and sometime
    legal adviser (<em>consultor</em>) to the Holy Office in New Spain.
    This eminent personage notes as a curious fact that the
    news of the murder of Don Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas
    was known on the Plaza Mayor of the City of Mexico
    on the very day that the murder occurred; but adds&mdash;his
    legal caution seemingly disposing him to hedge a
    little&mdash;that he is ignorant of the means by which the
    news was brought.</p>
<p>Without any hedging whatever, Fray Gaspar de
    San Agustin, in his <cite>Conquista de las Islas Philipinas</cite> (Madrid, 1698), tells the whole story in a whole-hearted
    way. According to Fray Gaspar, there arrived in
    Manila about the year 1593, Don Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas
    being at that time Governor, ambassadors sent
    by the King of Cambodia&mdash;one of them a Portuguese
    named Diego Belloso, and the other a Spaniard named
    Antonio Barrientes&mdash;whose mission was to ask the
    assistance of the Spaniards in repelling an invasion of
    Cambodia, then threatened by the King of Siam. As
    a present from the King to the Governor, the embassy
    brought &quot;two beautiful elephants (<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">dos hermosos
    elefantes</i>), which were the first ever seen in Manila.&quot;</p>
<p>Don Gómez Pérez promised readily the assistance
    asked for; but with the intention of using a pretended
    expedition to Cambodia as a cloak for a real expedition
    to seize the Moluccas. To this end he assembled an
    armada, made up of four galleys and of attendant
    smaller vessels, on which he embarked a considerable
    military force; and, along with the soldiers, certain
    &quot;notable persons and venerable religious.&quot; His preparations
    being completed, he sailed from Manila on
    October 17, 1593. A week later, the capitana galley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> having on board the Governor, was separated from the
    fleet by a storm and was driven to take shelter in the
    harbor of Punta de Azufre: to make which haven the
    two hundred and fifty Chinese rowers were kept at
    their work with so cruel a rigor, the climax of other
    cruelties, that they determined to mutiny. Accordingly,
    on the night of their arrival, October 25th,
    &quot;putting on white tunics that they might know each
    other in the darkness,&quot; they rose against the Spaniards
    and murdered every one of them&mdash;the Governor, as
    he came forth from his cabin, having &quot;his head half
    split open&quot;&mdash;and tossed their dead bodies overboard
    into the sea.</p>
<p>Fray Gaspar points out that Don Gómez Pérez came
    to that bad end as a just reward from heaven, because
    on various occasions he arrogantly had &quot;contended
    and disputed&quot; with the Bishop of the Filipinas; and
    in support of this view of the matter he declares that
    the Governor's deserved murder &quot;was announced in
    Manila and in Mexico by supernatural signs.&quot; In
    Manila the announcement was symbolical: &quot;On the
    very day of his killing there opened in the wall [of the
    Convent of San Agustin] on which his portrait was
    painted a crack that corresponded precisely with the
    splitting of his skull.&quot; Of the other announcement,
    that described in the legend, he writes in these assured
    terms: &quot;It is worthy of deep ponderation that on the
    very same day on which took place the tragedy of
    Gómez Pérez that tragedy was known in Mexico by the
    art of Satan: who, making use of some women inclined
    to such agilities (<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">algunas mujeres inclinadas á
    semejantes agilidades</i>), caused them to transplant to the
    Plaza Mayor of the City of Mexico a soldier standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> guard on the walls of Manila; and this was accomplished
    so unfelt by the soldier that in the morning&mdash;when he
    was found walking sentry, musket in hand, in that city&mdash;he
    asked of those who addressed him in what city
    he was. By the Holy Office it was ordered that he
    should be sent back to these islands: where many who
    knew him have assured me of the truth of this event.&quot;</p>
<p>Señor Obregón's comment, at once non-committal
    and impartial, on Fray Gaspar's narrative admits of
    no improvement. I give it in his own words: &quot;In the
    face of the asseveration of so brainy a chronicler (<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">un
    cronista tan sesudo</i>) we neither trump nor discard (<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">no
    ponemos ni quitamos rey</i>)&quot;; to which he adds a jingle
    advising the critical that he gives the story as it was
    given to him:</p>

<h3><span style="letter-spacing: 2px">LEGEND OF LA LLORONA</span></h3>
<p>This legend is not, as all of the other legends are, of
    Spanish-Mexican origin: it is wholly Mexican&mdash;a direct
    survival from primitive times. Seemingly without
    perceiving&mdash;certainly without noting&mdash;the connection
    between an Aztec goddess and this the most widely
    distributed of all Mexican folk-stories, Señor Orozco y
    Berra wrote:</p>
<p>&quot;The Tloque Nahuaque [Universal Creator] created
    in a garden a man and a woman who were the progenitors
    of the human race.... The woman was called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> Cihuacohuatl, 'the woman snake,' 'the female snake';
    Tititl, 'our mother,' or 'the womb whence we were
    born'; Teoyaominqui, 'the goddess who gathers the
    souls of the dead'; and Quilaztli, implying that she
    bears twins. She appears dressed in white, bearing
    on her shoulder a little cradle, as though she were
    carrying a child; and she can be heard sobbing and
    shrieking. This apparition was considered a bad
    omen.&quot; Referring to the same goddess, Fray Bernardino
    de Sahagun thus admonished (circa 1585) the
    Mexican converts to Christianity: &quot;Your ancestors
    also erred in the adoration of a demon whom they
    represented as a woman, and to whom they gave the
    name of Cioacoatl. She appeared clad as a lady of the
    palace [clad in white?]. She terrified (<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">espantada</i>), she
    frightened (<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">asombraba</i>), and cried aloud at night.&quot; It
    is evident from these citations that La Llorona is a
    stray from Aztec mythology; an ancient powerful
    goddess living on&mdash;her power for evil lessened, but still
    potent&mdash;into modern times.</p>
<p>She does not belong especially to the City of Mexico.
    The belief in her&mdash;once confined to, and still strongest
    in, the region primitively under Aztec domination&mdash;now
    has become localized in many other places throughout
    the country. This diffusion is in conformity with the
    recognized characteristic of folk-myths to migrate with
    those who believe in them; and in the case of La Llorona
    reasonably may be traced to the custom adopted by the
    Conquistadores of strengthening their frontier settlements
    by planting beside them settlements of loyal
    Aztecs: who, under their Christian veneering, would hold
    to&mdash;as to this day the so-called Christian Indians of Mexico
    hold to&mdash;their old-time faith in their old-time gods.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>
<p>Being transplanted, folk-myths are liable to modification
    by a new environment. The Fiery Cow of the
    City of Mexico, for instance, not improbably is a recasting
    of the Basque vaca de lumbre; or, possibly, of
    the goblin horse, El Belludo, of Grenada&mdash;who comes
    forth at midnight from the Siete Suelos tower of the
    Alhambra and scours the streets pursued by a pack
    of hell-hounds. But in her migrations, while given
    varying settings, La Llorona has remained unchanged.
    Always and everywhere she is the same: a woman
    clad in white who by night in lonely places goes wailing
    for her lost children; a creature of evil from whom none
    who hold converse with her may escape alive.</p>
<p>Don Vicente Riva Palacio's metrical version of this
    legend seems to be composite: a blending of the primitive
    myth with a real tragedy of Viceregal times. Introductorily,
    he tells that for more than two hundred
    years a popular tale has been current in varying forms
    of a mysterious woman, clad in white, who runs through
    the streets of the City at midnight uttering wailings
    so keen and so woful that whoever hears them swoons
    in a horror of fear. Then follows the story: Luisa,
    the Wailer, in life was a woman of the people, very
    beautiful. By her lover, Don Muño de Montes Claros,
    she had three children. That he might make a marriage
    with a lady of his own rank, he deserted her. Through
    a window of his house she saw him at his marriage
    feast; and then sped homeward and killed&mdash;with a
    dagger that Don Muño had left in her keeping&mdash;her
    children as they lay sleeping. Her white garments all
    spattered with their blood, she left her dead children
    and rushed wildly through the streets of the City&mdash;shrieking
    in the agony of her sorrow and her sin. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> end, &quot;a great crowd gathered to see a woman garroted
    because she had killed her three children&quot;; and on that
    same day &quot;a grand funeral procession&quot; went with Don
    Muño to his grave. And it is this Luisa who goes
    shrieking at night through the streets of the City even
    now.</p>
<p>My friend Gilberto Cano is my authority for the
    version of the legend&mdash;the popular version&mdash;that I
    have given in my text. It seems to me to preserve,
    in its awed mystery and in its vague fearsomeness, the
    very feeling with which the malignant Aztec goddess
    assuredly was regarded in primitive times.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
